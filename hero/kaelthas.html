<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> We’re happy to see that there is now more counter-
  play to how Kael’thas delivers his damage, and his Talent pick rates have
  dramatically improved. However, he has a lower win rate than we would like. We
  intended Kael’thas to be weak against enemy Heroes who dive on him but feel
  that we may have gone too far.  </p>
  
  <p>The changes to Flamestrike’s range should help him poke enemies from a safer
  distance (and build those Convection stacks!), and Living Bomb’s changes
  should help him be more threatening to enemies who want to stand toe to toe
  with him.  </p>
  
  <p>The change to Flamestrike’s base damage should help motivate players to use
  empowered Gravity Lapses more often, as they won’t lose potential Flamestrike
  damage when hitting stunned enemies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Kael’thas has had a lot of problems with his
  Talent pick rates. Chain Bomb has also evolved into a core part of the fantasy
  of playing the Hero, but was tied to a level 13 Talent. We decided to embrace
  this aspect of Kael’thas while introducing more counter-play to how he
  explodes Living Bomb so that it’s less frustrating to play against. Kael’thas
  should now be very effective at punishing enemy teams who clump together.  </p>
  
  <p>We also added many Talents to promote Flamestrike as his primary source of
  damage, as well as a few higher skill-cap Talents which allow players to
  better show off their mastery of the Hero.  </p>
  
  <p>All of this power comes at a price, however, and for Kael’thas it’s his
  survivability. He no longer has access to Bolt of the Storm, and Arcane
  Barrier’s Shield amount has been lowered and tied to a quest on Mana Addict.
  While Kael’thas can dish out a ton of damage in teamfights, he should be a
  much more viable target for enemy teams to focus down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Kael’thas is a powerful hero with too few
  downsides. We’re nerfing several aspects of his kit, and are still planning a
  Talent overhaul coming soon™. The stun duration of Gravity Lapse is too long
  and guarantees kills more often than we would like. Reducing the stun duration
  makes it less frustrating to play against and adds a bit more counterplay for
  the enemy team. Phoenix is the drastically favored Heroic Ability right now,
  and it’s up far too often. By nerfing its cooldown, while also pushing
  Pyroblast to create more impactful moments, we expect there will be more
  situations where Pyroblast is the optimal pick.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> We wanted to make Gathering Power a more high
  risk, high reward talent that encouraged specific gameplay. Now, with a much
  higher cap, the reward for this talent is much higher. The counterplay becomes
  the burden of the opposing team, as they’ll need to focus the Hero who has
  Gathering Power to reset their stacks.</p>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
          
              <p><strong>Ability Power Gains</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> This change was aimed at removing odd gameplay
  where a Nazeebo player may actually want to sacrifice his or her Gargantuan
  for a more powerful one. This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a
  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as
  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term
  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current
  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete
  duration of the effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>To clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:
<ul>
<li>For permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Abathur's Monstrosity</li>
<li>Nazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Jaina's Water Elemental</li>
<li>Sgt. Hammer's Blunt Force Gun</li>
<li>Tychus' Drakken Laser Drill</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

          
        
          
          
              <h4>Hero Updates</h4>
          
              <blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Prior to these changes, Kael’Thas had a high win
  rate, but his win rate wasn’t alarming. Instead, we’re focusing on Kael’thas’
  current gameplay, as it feels very set in stone and we’d like players to have
  the option to be creative. We’re smoothing out his power curve and making
  Pyroblast a more enticing choice.</p>

              <h4>Talents</h4>
          
              <p><strong>Bolt of the Storm</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We love this talent and think it can create a lot
  of really interesting moments, but the cooldown was just too short. At 70
  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players
  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use
  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased
  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic
  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds</li>
</ul>

          
        
          
          
              <p><strong>Gathering Power</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Gathering Power was simply too good and was
  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead
  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too
  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,
  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much
  longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help
  act as a ‘check point’.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The 5% starting Ability Power has been removed</li>
<li>Percentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1%</li>
<li>Instead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up)</li>
