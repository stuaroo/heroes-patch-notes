</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur <strong>every 4 minutes, with the first event
starting at the beginning of the match.</strong> Each weather event lasts for <strong>2
minutes</strong> before clearing up. This cycle will repeat <strong><s>periodically</s></strong>
until the game ends. While these weather events are active, Heroes can gain a
unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong><s>Periodically</s></strong> Strike all heroes with lightning <strong>every 25-40 seconds</strong>, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by <strong>15%</strong>.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for <strong>46</strong> damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li><strong>Heroes gain 28 Shields every 0.5 seconds, stacking up to 224 (8 stacks total).</strong></li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hanamura Temple</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  to reduce their damage as well as how powerful their Armor debuff is so that
  players are more incentivized to make aggressive plays when pushing. We'll be
  continuing to keep an eye on how these changes unfold, so please continue to
  give us your feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to the Call for Help system
  that should help the overall player experience. We believe that currently
  Towers are punishing aggressive play too much, so we're lowering their damage
  to give diving Heroes more time to make plays before they have to escape. Our
  goal overall with the system is to still have aggressive play be possible and
  rewarded, but to also give the defending team a way to punish prolonged Tower
  dives, which is primarily due to the stacking Armor debuff. We're also
  changing the A.I. of structures to require that both the attacking and
  defending Hero be in their range in order for them to switch aggro onto an
  aggressor. This means that the defending Hero needs to also be near their
  structures in order to be defended, and it removes some unintuitive situations
  where a Hero can get aggro from attacks that are happening in far away places.
  Lastly, periodic damage will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes, so
  Heroes like Lunara will no longer pull aggro for the entirety of their DoT
  effects.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players believe the pushing
  Samurai camp is too strong and the objective is too weak. For some insight, we
  purposefully designed the map so that the Samurai camp was uniquely powerful,
  and we wanted it to be a viable, effective strategy that was available for a
  large portion of the game, particularly since the map only has 2 lanes. Now
  that the map has been out for some time, we believe that the balance of power
  can shift a little in favor of the objective being a more central way to win
  the game.</p>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</strong></p>
<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>
<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core fires 2 volleys of missiles around it, dealing 5% maximum Health to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battlegrounds</h4>
              <p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we're excited for the experience globes and the
  increased clarity that they offer in regards to how experience is gained,
  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Nexus Anomaly - Experience Globes</strong></p>
<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>
<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thank you so much for all of the feedback regarding
  the 2019 Gameplay Updates. While there is still a lot of community speculation
  about the outcome of these changes, there has been a resounding amount of
  concern about the loss of Fort and Keep XP. We agree that the complete loss of
  XP from Forts and Keeps may reduce the incentive to kill them to unhealthy
  levels, especially at higher levels of play. In response, we have reintroduced
  XP to the structures in a way that will reward players for taking them early
  while granting a gradual increase in power instead of large bursts. This
  should reinforce our goal of making matches closer while also rewarding teams
  for destroying enemy structures as quick as possible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> After listening to feedback, we have decided to pull
  back the laning Mercenary change outlined in our 2019 gameplay updates in
  order to give winning teams more opportunities to pull ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boss Camps, Sentinel Camps (Hanamura Temple), and Support Camps (Volskaya Foundry) will now be flagged as Elite. 
<ul>
<li>Elite Mercenary Camps are Unstoppable &amp; Unbribable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Radii</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The unit radius values for most Heroes has been reduced by 5-15%</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In an effort to improve visual clarity when many
  heroes are on-screen, we've updated the art for the Hero Ring displayed
  underneath heroes. To reinforce this effort, we've also done a pass on the
  Unit Radii for all heroes. We understand that these radius adjustments will
  have a minor but intended impact on landing and dodging abilities, and as a
  result, felt that the 2019 Gameplay Updates were the best time to make these
  changes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking some of the experience offered by outer
  Towers and distributing it amongst other Structures in an effort to keep teams
  closer in levels for a little while longer. We still want to reward skillful
  play, but a team that completes the first objective is frequently able take
  out a lot of the opposing team's outer Structures. Not only did this open up a
  strategic advantage (Healing Fountains get destroyed, Fortifications provide
  less safety), but it also pushes the winning team further ahead. Usually, this
  results in one team reaching level 10 before their opponents, allowing them to
  snowball to an even greater lead. We'd like to instead slow down early game
  leads, so that winning teams have to play well for a longer period of time.</p>

<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As expected, our gameplay update for 2018 resulted in
  large changes to many of our game systems. While we’re overall happy with the
  direction of the update, there have been some unintended side effects that
  we’re hoping to remedy. We overestimated how much more powerful unlimited ammo
  would be for Structures, and as a result pushing mechanics have become too
  strong, resulting in lower game times on nearly all maps. We’re giving our
  towers some of their teeth back with this update, which should help teams hold
  pushes from Mercenary Camps and map events. We’re also making some tuning
  changes to some of our Mercenary Camps now that we have had some time to see
  how they have been performing. Hellbats and Knights in particular are pushing
  harder than we would like, so we’re reducing their power. We’re also taking a
  look at the Warhead Junction boss and reducing its early and mid-game pushing
  power, as right now it is too strong when combined with Nukes from the map
  event. Lastly, we are reducing the power of Regeneration Globes. While we like
  the new mini-game that Neutral Regen globes provide in the laning phase, we
  are not comfortable with how much they are currently benefitting the team that
  is ahead while they are pushing into a defending team. We’re also seeing
  players picking up more Regeneration Globes in general, so this will help to
  keep the game’s overall sustain in check. These are some hefty changes, and
  it’s likely that there will be more needed to be done over time as things
  continue to settle. We’ll be keeping an eye on things, and are prepared to
  make more updates as they’re needed.</p>

<li>Mercenary item drops no longer require a short channel time to be picked up.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> This change is aimed at making the flow of picking
  up items from mercenary camps smoother and more intuitive. We found the flow
  of defeating a mercenary camp, capturing it, then channeling on the dropped
  item was disruptive to what players are accustomed to with typical mercenary
  camps.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support Camps can no longer be captured with "Bribe" talents.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thanks for all of the early responses on Volskaya
  Foundry. We’re making this change in response to consistent community
  feedback.</p>

              <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protected Cores</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both Cores are protected by a barrier that cannot be attacked by Heroes.</li>
<li>Payloads must be escorted across the Battleground in order to deal damage to the enemy Core.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Escort Payloads</strong>
<ul>
<li>The first set of Payloads spawn for each team after 2:30 into the match, and additional waves will periodically spawn throughout the rest of the game.</li>
<li>Stand near an allied payload to escort it. The more allies who are present to escort a payload, the faster it will move. This effect caps at 3 nearby allies.</li>
<li>Payloads that haven’t been escorted for a period of time will begin to slowly move backward.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Empowered Payloads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Destroying enemy Forts will cause the next allied Payload to deal additional damage when it arrives at its destination.</li>
<li>Destroying enemy Keeps will cause Sappers to spawn with allied Minion waves, which will fire on the Core upon reaching the end of their lanes.</li>
<li>Deal a total of 7 damage the opposing Core to claim victory!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mercenary Camps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three types of Mercenary Camps exist on Hanamura, and captured Mercenaries will not travel down a lane to attack enemies.
<ul>
<li>Instead, captured Mercenary Camps will each award one of three consumable power-ups.</li>
<li>Right-click a power-up to collect it, and then use the “Map Mechanic Ability” hotkey (Default: F) to activate it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recon Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reward: Dragon Spirits
<ul>
<li>Release 3 Dragon Spirits that seek out enemy Heroes, who are then revealed for 5 seconds. Dragon Spirits are destroyed after finding enemy Heroes or after 10 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fortification Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reward: Turret
<ul>
<li>Place a Turret on the ground or on your team’s payload.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Support Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reward: Healing Pulse
<ul>
<li>Restore 35% Health and 23% Mana to you and your allies over 15 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mega Enforcer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defeat the Mega Enforcer found at the center of Hanamura to fire 1 shot on the opposing Core.</li>
