<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve noticed some rather un-fun behavior in the
  form of sniping Healing Wells over time using very long range Abilities. While
  we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective
  given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable
  portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer
  your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away
  every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield. Only
  <em>you</em> can protect Healing Wells from those pesky Arcane Orbs!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We don’t like the common (and, usually, optimal)
  gameplay tactic of playing hit-and-run with the Garden Terror. Chasing it as
  it ran between lanes dropping Overgrowths wasn’t enjoyable for the defending
  team, and didn’t fit the spirit of what the Garden Terror was intended to do.
  The new functionality attempts to create a larger “moment” when Overgrowth is
  placed, as it gives a huge bonus—provided the Garden Terror can attack—and
  also makes killing the Overgrowth a bigger deal. Overall, we think Garden
  Terror combat will be more interesting and tactical.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The scaling changes we released in December made

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Scaling Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health and damage scaling for all Heroes, Battleground Events, Minions, and Mercenaries has been changed from flat, additive values to values that are multiplicative by percentage.</li>
<li>A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked.  This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead.  We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios.   As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level.  Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously.   The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game.  Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game.  It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Respawn Timers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> In order to reward players for getting early game
  Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low
  levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with
  it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead,
  early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy
  enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries.
  These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory,
  without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the
  opposing enemy team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attack Speed Slows</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We didn’t like the gameplay of Garden Terrors
  being used defensively to slow down an enemy Garden Terror push. Now that the
  Overgrowth can disable the Core, it will be much less effective to defend as a
  Garden Terror, encouraging teams to be more offensive with their Garden
  Terrors.</p>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>A.I. Talent Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. controlled Heroes will now select their Talents from a group of preset Talent builds.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A.I. players will now choose from predetermined
  Talent builds instead of randomly selecting Talents. This is especially
  important for players who disconnect as the A.I. will now no longer randomly
  choose Talents, but instead try to pick builds that are closer to what players
  would expect. In addition, A.I. controlled Heroes in Versus A.I. games will
  also have their own Talent builds to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles and Regeneration Globe Interaction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Regeneration Globes will no longer heal Dragon Knights and Garden Terrors.

<li>Instead, Regeneration Globe effects will now be applied directly to the Hero inside the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players within a Dragon Knight or Garden Terror can now also accumulate stacks for Talents such as Seasoned Marksman, Gathering Power, Regeneration Master, etc.</li>

<p><strong>Summoned Unit Attacks</strong></p>
