<li>Towers, Forts, and Keeps now deal 50% bonus damage to Heroes</li>
<li>Cores will now display an “Invulnerable” message if attacked by an enemy when no allied Keeps have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Structures can no longer be made Vulnerable</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The scaling changes we released in December made
  it so Heroes could dive into Structures with impunity during the early game.
  Increasing the damage that Structures deal to Heroes allows defending players
  to feel a bit safer. We are exploring other fixes to help Structures feel more
  meaningful throughout the game and will release them when they are ready.</p>

<ul>
<li>Battleground-specific creatures are now universally defined as <strong>Monsters</strong> (ex: Neutral Garden Terrors, Sky Temple Guardians, etc.)</li>
<li>Several Talents and Abilities have been changed to reflect this new categorization, and the following no longer affect Monsters:
<ul>
<li>Mercenary Lord</li>
<li>Johanna's Knight Takes Pawn</li>
<li>Lunara's Cruel Bloom</li>
<li>Rexxar's Easy Prey and Bird of Prey</li>
<li>The Butcher's Chop Meat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The following now affect Monsters:
<ul>
<li>Anub'arak's Beetle, Juiced</li>
<li>Azmodan's Demonic Smite</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several Talents that could previously trigger against both captured Mercenaries and Minions will now only affect Minions (ex: Seasoned Marksman, Black Soulstone, etc.)</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Scaling Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health and damage scaling for all Heroes, Battleground Events, Minions, and Mercenaries has been changed from flat, additive values to values that are multiplicative by percentage.</li>
<li>A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked.  This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead.  We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios.   As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level.  Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously.   The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game.  Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game.  It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Respawn Timers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> In order to reward players for getting early game
  Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low
  levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with
  it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead,
  early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy
  enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries.
  These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory,
  without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the
  opposing enemy team.</p>

<p><strong>Attack Speed Slows</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.</li>

<li>A.I. controlled Heroes will now select their Talents from a group of preset Talent builds.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A.I. players will now choose from predetermined
  Talent builds instead of randomly selecting Talents. This is especially
  important for players who disconnect as the A.I. will now no longer randomly
  choose Talents, but instead try to pick builds that are closer to what players
  would expect. In addition, A.I. controlled Heroes in Versus A.I. games will
  also have their own Talent builds to choose from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vehicles and Regeneration Globe Interaction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Regeneration Globes will no longer heal Dragon Knights and Garden Terrors.
<ul>
<li>Instead, Regeneration Globe effects will now be applied directly to the Hero inside the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players within a Dragon Knight or Garden Terror can now also accumulate stacks for Talents such as Seasoned Marksman, Gathering Power, Regeneration Master, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summoned Unit Attacks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will now miss if that Summon is Blinded or the target is Evading.</li>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will no longer consume Block Talent stacks.</li>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A small number of Tomb games tend to run
  significantly longer than intended, so we altered the scaling of the Spider
  mechanic to prevent drawn out stalemates in the late game. Our hope is to see
  shorter matches overall.</p>

<li>Spider Minions and enemy Heroes will drop magical Gems of Power upon death.
<ul>
<li>Collect these Gems and turn them in to the Spider Queen’s Altars, which can be found in-between lanes at the center of the Battleground.</li>

<li>Once either team has relinquished enough Gems to the Spider Queen, her Webweavers will descend and travel down each lane to siege the opposing team on three fronts.
<ul>
<li>Each team can summon Webweavers by turning in 50 Gems. The number of required Gems will increase by 5 for each subsequent wave.</li>
<li>Be sure to turn in Gems promptly! Gems collected by a player will be dropped upon death, but can be picked up by allied Heroes.</li>
