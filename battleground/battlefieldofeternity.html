              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Core</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Victory determination is now much more precise in situations where both Cores are destroyed within fractions of a second. As a result, Victory will no longer be decided at random in cases where it appears that both Cores are destroyed at the same moment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regeneration Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Health Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 6.24% of maximum Health over 4 seconds</li>
<li>Now: Restore 12% of maximum Health over 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 32 Mana over 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 8% of maximum Mana over 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Thank you for all your discussion and feedback on
  our recent Health sustain post! We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it
  but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the
  increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a
  bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much
  larger impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Healing Wells</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Health Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 40% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 20% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we
  wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again,
  we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and
  added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make
  the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Minions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Our goal with this change is to make escorting
  Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do
  some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP
  carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the
  Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Catapult Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack range increased by 20%.</li>
<li>Sight range increased by 17%.</li>
<li>Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a
  Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off
  before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a
  Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more
  consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity:</strong> AI Heroes can now halt their attacks on Immortals at the center of the Battleground in order to gank an enemy Sgt. Hammer that is attacking inner-Towers and Keeps.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>25% of a Healing Well’s maximum Health has been converted into a Shield. Shield Regeneration delay of 8 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve noticed some rather un-fun behavior in the
  form of sniping Healing Wells over time using very long range Abilities. While
  we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective
  given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable
  portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer
  your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away
  every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield. Only
  <em>you</em> can protect Healing Wells from those pesky Arcane Orbs!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The scaling changes we released in December made
  it so Heroes could dive into Structures with impunity during the early game.
  Increasing the damage that Structures deal to Heroes allows defending players
  to feel a bit safer. We are exploring other fixes to help Structures feel more
  meaningful throughout the game and will release them when they are ready.</p>

              <p><strong>Scaling Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health and damage scaling for all Heroes, Battleground Events, Minions, and Mercenaries has been changed from flat, additive values to values that are multiplicative by percentage.</li>
<li>A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked.  This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead.  We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios.   As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level.  Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously.   The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game.  Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game.  It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Respawn Timers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> In order to reward players for getting early game
  Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low
  levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with
  it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead,
  early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy
  enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries.
  These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory,
  without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the
  opposing enemy team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attack Speed Slows</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.</li>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>A.I. Talent Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. controlled Heroes will now select their Talents from a group of preset Talent builds.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A.I. players will now choose from predetermined
  Talent builds instead of randomly selecting Talents. This is especially
  important for players who disconnect as the A.I. will now no longer randomly
  choose Talents, but instead try to pick builds that are closer to what players
  would expect. In addition, A.I. controlled Heroes in Versus A.I. games will
  also have their own Talent builds to choose from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vehicles and Regeneration Globe Interaction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Regeneration Globes will no longer heal Dragon Knights and Garden Terrors.
<ul>
<li>Instead, Regeneration Globe effects will now be applied directly to the Hero inside the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players within a Dragon Knight or Garden Terror can now also accumulate stacks for Talents such as Seasoned Marksman, Gathering Power, Regeneration Master, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summoned Unit Attacks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will now miss if that Summon is Blinded or the target is Evading.</li>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will no longer consume Block Talent stacks.</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>Immortal</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage increased from 360 (+22 per minute) to 360 (+25 per minute) after 11 minutes have passed, and 360 (+30 per minute) after 16 minutes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Matches on Battlefield could occasionally go quite
  long as the Immortals weren’t scaling high enough into the late game. With
  this slight damage increase they’ll be more of a threat as the game
  progresses.</p>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <p>The conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells has spilled into
the Nexus, breeding a new Battleground that is equal parts righteous and
wicked. Angels, Demons, and now Heroes clash in ceaseless combat in their
struggle for dominance over the <strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Battlefield of Eternity is a two-lane Battleground featuring two massive Immortals that battle endlessly at its center, and teams must compete to defeat the opposing Immortal.</li>
<li>Once its foe has been toppled, the victorious Immortal will be restored to full Health, and proceed to seek out enemy Structures, attacking down the lane with the most remaining defenses.</li>
<li>An attacking Immortal will also gain a Shield, proportionate to the amount of Health it had remaining at the end of the battle.
<ul>
<li>The Immortal will perform ranged attacks, which each consume a portion of its Shield. Taking damage will also drain the Immortal’s Shield.</li>
<li>Once its Shield has been expended, the Immortal will only attack at melee range.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fallen</strong> <strong>Shaman</strong>
<ul>
<li>These malformed demons never stray too far from a pack of Fallen Hounds, and will quickly resurrect any Hounds that are killed in combat. Those who value their souls would be wise to first destroy the Shaman before targeting its Hound companions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Khazra</strong>
<ul>
<li>The half human, half goat creatures that inhabit Battlefield of Eternity are tough, ranged attackers that won’t hesitate to rain spears on their foes. Defeat the Khazra at their camps to harness their destructive appetite before the enemy team.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Battleground, More Often</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Starting today, the pool of Battlegrounds available in all modes, except Custom Games, will be temporarily limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>Battlefield of Eternity</li>
<li>Sky Temple</li>
<li>Tomb of the Spider Queen</li>
<li>Cursed Hollow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This has been done to increase the frequency with which players encounter the new Battleground, Battlefield of Eternity.</li>
<li>During this time, players can still select and play on any Battleground they wish using Custom Games.</li>
<li>All Battlegrounds, including Battlefield of Eternity, will once again be made available for play in all matchmaking game modes on Tuesday, July 7.</li>
</ul>
