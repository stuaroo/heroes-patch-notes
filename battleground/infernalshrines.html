              <p><strong>Mounts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed reduced from 40 to 30%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regeneration Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time before Globes despawn reduced from 8 to 6 seconds</li>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>Khazra Impaler</strong>
<ul>
<li>Captured Impaler attack damage increased from 40 to 46</li>

              <h4>Battlegrounds</h4>
              <p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously all Mercenary camps spawned at 120 seconds. The following adjustments have been made to spawn times:
<ul>
<li>90 seconds: Sappers, Doubloon Pirates</li>
<li>120 seconds: Siege Giants (unchanged), Impalers (unchanged)</li>
<li>150 seconds: Knights, Fallen Shaman</li>
<li>180 seconds: Grave Golem (unchanged)</li>
<li>300 seconds: Headless Horseman (unchanged)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Captured Mercenaries will no longer grant Experience when killed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We started playtesting with staggered Mercenary
  Camp spawn times, and quickly began to realize that it added more strategic
  depth to the game, and coincided with some of our Battleground events. We have
  been happy with the changes overall, and are listening to any feedback you may
  have!</p>

              <p><strong>Core</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Victory determination is now much more precise in situations where both Cores are destroyed within fractions of a second. As a result, Victory will no longer be decided at random in cases where it appears that both Cores are destroyed at the same moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regeneration Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 6.24% of maximum Health over 4 seconds</li>
<li>Now: Restore 12% of maximum Health over 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 32 Mana over 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 8% of maximum Mana over 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Thank you for all your discussion and feedback on
  our recent Health sustain post! We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it
  but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the
  increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a
  bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much
  larger impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Healing Wells</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Health Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 40% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 20% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we
  wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again,
  we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and
  added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make
  the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Minions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Our goal with this change is to make escorting
  Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do
  some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP
  carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the
  Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catapult Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack range increased by 20%.</li>
<li>Sight range increased by 17%.</li>
<li>Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a
  Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off
  before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a
  Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more
  consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines:</strong> Punishers will no longer prefer to attack non-Heroic enemies that are affected by Abathur’s Symbiote over enemy Heroes.</li>

<ul>
<li>25% of a Healing Well’s maximum Health has been converted into a Shield. Shield Regeneration delay of 8 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve noticed some rather un-fun behavior in the
  form of sniping Healing Wells over time using very long range Abilities. While
  we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective
  given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable
  portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer
  your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away
  every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield. Only
  <em>you</em> can protect Healing Wells from those pesky Arcane Orbs!</p>
</blockquote>

<li><strong>Frozen Punisher</strong>

<li>Root duration while frozen decreased from 2 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Although we are very happy with the current tuning
  of Infernal Shrines, we have been noticing a tendency to under-value the first
  couple of Punishers. In order to help incentivize players into valuing them,
  we have boosted their starting Health and decreased their early scaling values
  to compensate. While early event Punishers should be a bit stronger, any event
  past the 15-minute mark should be identical to those from the previous patch. </p>
<p>Frozen Punishers are great at zoning enemy teams but we felt they were a bit
  too easy to avoid without preliminary team initiation. These changes should
  increase the frequency in which players get rooted, while feeling a little
  less punishing when this occurs.</p>

<li>The following now affect Monsters:
<ul>
<li>Anub'arak's Beetle, Juiced</li>
<li>Azmodan's Demonic Smite</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several Talents that could previously trigger against both captured Mercenaries and Minions will now only affect Minions (ex: Seasoned Marksman, Black Soulstone, etc.)</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li>The minimap now more clearly indicates when a Shrine is ready to activate</li>
<li><strong>Arcane Punisher</strong>
<ul>
<li>Arcane Sentry damage reduced by 20%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The Arcane Punishers have shown to be more
  effective than their Frozen and Mortar counterparts, so we lowered their
  Arcane Sentry damage to bring them more in line with other Punisher types.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4>Battlegrounds</h4>
              <p><strong>Structures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Towers, Forts, and Keeps now deal 50% bonus damage to Heroes</li>
<li>Cores will now display an “Invulnerable” message if attacked by an enemy when no allied Keeps have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Structures can no longer be made Vulnerable</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The scaling changes we released in December made
  it so Heroes could dive into Structures with impunity during the early game.
  Increasing the damage that Structures deal to Heroes allows defending players
  to feel a bit safer. We are exploring other fixes to help Structures feel more
  meaningful throughout the game and will release them when they are ready.</p>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Scaling Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Health and damage scaling for all Heroes, Battleground Events, Minions, and Mercenaries has been changed from flat, additive values to values that are multiplicative by percentage.</li>
<li>A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Respawn Timers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> In order to reward players for getting early game
  Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low
  levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with
  it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead,
  early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy
  enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries.
  These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory,
  without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the
  opposing enemy team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Attack Speed Slows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.</li>
</ul>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
              <ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented Hero vision radiuses from displaying on Infernal Shrines and Battlefield of Eternity minimaps. </li>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>A.I. Talent Selection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A.I. controlled Heroes will now select their Talents from a group of preset Talent builds.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A.I. players will now choose from predetermined
  Talent builds instead of randomly selecting Talents. This is especially
  important for players who disconnect as the A.I. will now no longer randomly
  choose Talents, but instead try to pick builds that are closer to what players
  would expect. In addition, A.I. controlled Heroes in Versus A.I. games will
  also have their own Talent builds to choose from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vehicles and Regeneration Globe Interaction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regeneration Globes will no longer heal Dragon Knights and Garden Terrors.
<ul>
<li>Instead, Regeneration Globe effects will now be applied directly to the Hero inside the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players within a Dragon Knight or Garden Terror can now also accumulate stacks for Talents such as Seasoned Marksman, Gathering Power, Regeneration Master, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summoned Unit Attacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will now miss if that Summon is Blinded or the target is Evading.</li>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will no longer consume Block Talent stacks.</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>Punisher</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting and scaling Health decreased by 10%</li>
<li>Now leap to the nearest enemy Hero within range, rather than selecting one at random</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skeletal Defenders</strong>
<ul>
<li>The amount of Skeletal Defenders required to summon a Punisher has been increased from 30 to 40.</li>
<li>Skeletal Defenders will no longer take increased damage from abilities and talents that deal bonus damage to minions.</li>
<li>The range at which Skeletal Defenders will detect and attack players has been decreased by 25%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Player feedback has been centered around how hard
  it is to comeback when falling behind on Infernal Shrines. We agree that the
  Punishers are overly punishing, so we’re nerfing their Health slightly. Teams
  that successfully bait the Punishers deep within their base will be able to
  put an end to this threat sooner.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
              <ul>
<li>Corrected an issue that could cause Punishers to prioritize attacking enemy Structures after initially targeting a Hero.</li>
</ul>

              <ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that allowed Punishers to attack structures while enraged on the Infernal Shrines Battleground.</li>
</ul>

              <ul>
<li>Skeletal Defender Health will now properly scale over time on the Infernal Shrines Battleground.</li>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li>This three-lane Battleground features three Infernal Shrines that will periodically gather power. Only one Shrine will gather power at any given time, and either team can activate it to unleash its might.</li>
<li>Once activated, the Shrine’s Guardians will pour forth in waves to defend it. The first team to kill 30 Guardians will summon a devastating Punisher to fight for their cause.</li>
<li>A Punisher is a powerful boss that will attack down the lane that corresponds with the Shrine it was summoned from. Punishers will hunt down any nearby enemy Heroes that cross its path, and can spawn with one of three deadly affixes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcane</strong> – The Punisher summons beams of arcane energy which rotate in a circular motion, and deal massive damage to enemy targets they pass through.</li>
<li><strong>Frozen</strong> – The Punisher calls forth frigid ice shards, which explode after a short delay, dealing damage and freezing enemies in place for a short time.</li>
<li><strong>Mortar</strong> – The Punisher launches a stream of firebombs high into the air, which explode and deal damage to any enemies they strike upon landing.</li>
