<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players dislike how their
  Healing Fountains can be sniped by the opposing team early in the game. While
  we agree that this can be frustrating, we don't want to completely remove
  alternative strategies for creating an advantage. We're experimenting with a
  change to move the total Health of the Healing Fountains to be much more in
  favor of a Shield that quickly regenerates instead of Health. This should make
  it riskier for players to snipe Healing Fountains, as they will not get any
  value unless they destroy the building, while also rewarding players who are
  able to protect their Healing Fountains early in the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur <strong>every 4 minutes, with the first event
starting at the beginning of the match.</strong> Each weather event lasts for <strong>2
minutes</strong> before clearing up. This cycle will repeat <strong><s>periodically</s></strong>
until the game ends. While these weather events are active, Heroes can gain a
unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong><s>Periodically</s></strong> Strike all heroes with lightning <strong>every 25-40 seconds</strong>, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by <strong>15%</strong>.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for <strong>46</strong> damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li><strong>Heroes gain 28 Shields every 0.5 seconds, stacking up to 224 (8 stacks total).</strong></li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Towers of Doom</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thank you for your discussions and feedback regarding

  still too punishing to dive under for lengthy periods of time, so we're going
  to reduce their damage as well as how powerful their Armor debuff is so that
  players are more incentivized to make aggressive plays when pushing. We'll be
  continuing to keep an eye on how these changes unfold, so please continue to
  give us your feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to the Call for Help system
  that should help the overall player experience. We believe that currently
  Towers are punishing aggressive play too much, so we're lowering their damage
  to give diving Heroes more time to make plays before they have to escape. Our
  goal overall with the system is to still have aggressive play be possible and
  rewarded, but to also give the defending team a way to punish prolonged Tower
  dives, which is primarily due to the stacking Armor debuff. We're also
  changing the A.I. of structures to require that both the attacking and
  defending Hero be in their range in order for them to switch aggro onto an
  aggressor. This means that the defending Hero needs to also be near their
  structures in order to be defended, and it removes some unintuitive situations
  where a Hero can get aggro from attacks that are happening in far away places.
  Lastly, periodic damage will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes, so
  Heroes like Lunara will no longer pull aggro for the entirety of their DoT
  effects.</p>

              <p><strong>Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</strong></p>
<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>
<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battlegrounds</h4>
              <p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>

  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

              <p><strong>Nexus Anomaly - Experience Globes</strong></p>
<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>
<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thank you so much for all of the feedback regarding
  the 2019 Gameplay Updates. While there is still a lot of community speculation
  about the outcome of these changes, there has been a resounding amount of
  concern about the loss of Fort and Keep XP. We agree that the complete loss of
  XP from Forts and Keeps may reduce the incentive to kill them to unhealthy
  levels, especially at higher levels of play. In response, we have reintroduced
  XP to the structures in a way that will reward players for taking them early
  while granting a gradual increase in power instead of large bursts. This
  should reinforce our goal of making matches closer while also rewarding teams
  for destroying enemy structures as quick as possible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> After listening to feedback, we have decided to pull
  back the laning Mercenary change outlined in our 2019 gameplay updates in
  order to give winning teams more opportunities to pull ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boss Camps, Sentinel Camps (Hanamura Temple), and Support Camps (Volskaya Foundry) will now be flagged as Elite. 
<ul>
<li>Elite Mercenary Camps are Unstoppable &amp; Unbribable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Radii</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The unit radius values for most Heroes has been reduced by 5-15%</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In an effort to improve visual clarity when many
  heroes are on-screen, we've updated the art for the Hero Ring displayed
  underneath heroes. To reinforce this effort, we've also done a pass on the
  Unit Radii for all heroes. We understand that these radius adjustments will
  have a minor but intended impact on landing and dodging abilities, and as a
  result, felt that the 2019 Gameplay Updates were the best time to make these
  changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking some of the experience offered by outer
  Towers and distributing it amongst other Structures in an effort to keep teams
  closer in levels for a little while longer. We still want to reward skillful
  play, but a team that completes the first objective is frequently able take
  out a lot of the opposing team's outer Structures. Not only did this open up a
  strategic advantage (Healing Fountains get destroyed, Fortifications provide
  less safety), but it also pushes the winning team further ahead. Usually, this
  results in one team reaching level 10 before their opponents, allowing them to
  snowball to an even greater lead. We'd like to instead slow down early game
  leads, so that winning teams have to play well for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>​&gt; <em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As expected, our gameplay update for 2018 resulted in
large changes to many of our game systems. While we’re overall happy with the
direction of the update, there have been some unintended side effects that
we’re hoping to remedy. We overestimated how much more powerful unlimited ammo
would be for Structures, and as a result pushing mechanics have become too
strong, resulting in lower game times on nearly all maps. We’re giving our
towers some of their teeth back with this update, which should help teams hold
pushes from Mercenary Camps and map events. We’re also making some tuning
changes to some of our Mercenary Camps now that we have had some time to see
how they have been performing. Hellbats and Knights in particular are pushing
harder than we would like, so we’re reducing their power. We’re also taking a
look at the Warhead Junction boss and reducing its early and mid-game pushing
power, as right now it is too strong when combined with Nukes from the map
event. Lastly, we are reducing the power of Regeneration Globes. While we like
the new mini-game that Neutral Regen globes provide in the laning phase, we
are not comfortable with how much they are currently benefitting the team that
is ahead while they are pushing into a defending team. We’re also seeing
players picking up more Regeneration Globes in general, so this will help to
keep the game’s overall sustain in check. These are some hefty changes, and
it’s likely that there will be more needed to be done over time as things
continue to settle. We’ll be keeping an eye on things, and are prepared to
make more updates as they’re needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> With today’s patch you will notice that a lot of
  our tooltips that used to reference the Resistant/Vulnerable system have been
  changed. Matthew Cooper <a href="https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20752266255">detailed the changes on our
  forums</a> last month
  explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed,
  the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit
  during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any
  different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we
  have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s
  Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release
  and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor
  System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy
  (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the
  game.</p>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Core</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Victory determination is now much more precise in situations where both Cores are destroyed within fractions of a second. As a result, Victory will no longer be decided at random in cases where it appears that both Cores are destroyed at the same moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regeneration Globes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 6.24% of maximum Health over 4 seconds</li>
<li>Now: Restore 12% of maximum Health over 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 32 Mana over 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 8% of maximum Mana over 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Thank you for all your discussion and feedback on
  our recent Health sustain post! We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it
  but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the
  increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a
  bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much
  larger impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Healing Wells</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Health Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 40% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mana Regeneration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previously: Restore 20% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we
  wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again,
  we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and
  added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make
  the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Minions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Our goal with this change is to make escorting
  Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do
  some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP
  carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the
  Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catapult Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack range increased by 20%.</li>
<li>Sight range increased by 17%.</li>
<li>Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a
  Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off
  before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a
  Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more
  consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.</p>

<ul>
<li>25% of a Healing Well’s maximum Health has been converted into a Shield. Shield Regeneration delay of 8 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve noticed some rather un-fun behavior in the
  form of sniping Healing Wells over time using very long range Abilities. While
  we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective
  given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable
  portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer
  your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away
  every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield. Only
  <em>you</em> can protect Healing Wells from those pesky Arcane Orbs!</p>

              <h4>Design & Gameplay</h4>
              <p><strong>Scaling Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Health and damage scaling for all Heroes, Battleground Events, Minions, and Mercenaries has been changed from flat, additive values to values that are multiplicative by percentage.</li>
<li>A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Respawn Timers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> In order to reward players for getting early game
  Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low
  levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with
  it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead,
  early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy
  enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries.
  These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory,
  without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the
  opposing enemy team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Attack Speed Slows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.</li>
</ul>

              <h4>Battleground Updates</h4>
              <p>The Grave Keeper and Raven Lord have risen over a dark and mysterious city,
each seeking to add it to the territories under their control. Now, these
Realm Lords call upon the aid of Heroes in their battle for dominance over the
Towers of Doom.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please note</strong>: Towers of Doom is not currently available in the live version of Heroes of the Storm, as PTR testing has not yet concluded. Click here for more information.</li>
<li>Each Core on this Battleground is surrounded by an indestructible barrier, and cannot be razed by Heroes, Minions, or Mercenaries.
<ul>
<li>Instead, Heroes must capture the Altars that periodically activate within the city. Upon doing so, each of the Bell Towers controlled by the capturing team will fire a payload that damages the opposing Core.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bell Tower allegiance is fickle! A Bell Tower that has been destroyed will respawn after a short delay, aligning itself with the team that took it down.
<ul>
<li>Toppling a Bell Tower not only increases a team’s area of control over the Battleground, but also grants an additional payload in the volleys that fire on the enemy Core after capturing an Altar.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Towers of Doom Available Now on PTR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Towers of Doom is the only Battleground available for play in PTR matchmaking queues.
<ul>
<li>Battleground pools on the PTR have been reduced so that more thorough Towers of Doom playtesting can be done, and any bugs discovered during this time can be fixed before the Battleground is officially released.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Please note</strong>: Towers of Doom will not be available in the live version of Heroes immediately on patch day, but will remain playable on the PTR until playtesting concludes on November 24. </li>
