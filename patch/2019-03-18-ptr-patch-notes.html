<ul>
<li>The cap on maximum negative Armor has been increased from -25 to -75, now that different Armor effects no longer stack 
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The negative Armor cap was originally instituted as a safety precaution so that stacking long term negative Armor effects wouldn't lead to degenerate gameplay. We don't anticipate many effects to go beyond -25, but there are a few cases where this can happen (including the new Unraveling Talent on Chromie and Sgt. Hammer's Shrapnel Mines).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hero Roles Update 
<ul>
<li>Updated roles include: Tank, Bruiser, Support, Healer, Melee Assassin, and Ranged Assassin</li>
<li>For more information, please review our blog <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/">here</a></li>

<li>Loot chests are no longer available for Gem purchase</li>
<li>Rare loot chests are now available for Gold purchase (3000 each)</li>

<h3 id="new-event-caldeum-complex">New Event: Caldeum Complex</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Caldeum Arcopolis, 2103 AD. A city bought and sold a hundred
times over, now giant Mega Corporations hold more sway in the ever-shifting
politics of the world than governments. Down on the rain slicked streets,
humans, mutants, machines and synthetics all struggle to find their place in
the light of the neon glow beneath the towering monuments to capitalism
lording over them.</p>

<p>With such oppression, the common people often turn to a life of crime. The
leader of one of the largest gangs, the Azure Dragons, goes by the nickname,
<strong>Chromie.</strong> Both a hacker and an anti-corporate street artist, many have said
her work has an almost prophetic quality, as if she sees through time itself.
The corporate media would have you believe she uses her gang of hackers to
illegally ensure her prophecies become true, but lately her work has turned
dark, as if she's seen a cataclysmic force on the horizon…</p>

<p>Recently, the Dragons have found an ally in the Onyx Turtles. While it's rare
to see the gangs working together, as the noose of systemic oppression has
grown tighter, those in the underbelly of the mega-city have had to find new
ways to survive. <strong>Kharazim</strong> and his Turtles are a harder sort of stock than
most, with many known gladiators and street fighters serving in the ranks.
This new alliance has provided the Azure dragons a strong defense against
threats in the physical world.</p>

<p>High above, the Jigoku Cybenetics Corporation, a primary manufacturer of
mechanical augmentations, has become a target of both groups. In the mean
streets, human enhancement has become one of the few options left to move the
playing field more into the favor of those willing to bend the law. But their
efforts have not gone unnoticed, and any who would dare to impugn the honor of
Jigoku find themselves in the sights of the CyberOni, Jigoku's elite agents:
merciless killers at the beck and call of their bureaucratic masters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lúcio's rework is unlocking some new ways to help your allies and further harass your enemies! His old Trait, Wall Ride, is still completely functional but has been moved to his Mount (Z). The replacement Trait, Push Off, is a new utility Ability that gives Lúcio more mobility with a built-in way to peel enemies for his allies.</p>
  
  <p>That is just the beginning, though, as Lúcio has also gained a new Heroic
  Ability—High Five. This Ability allows him a small bit of burst healing to
  help compete with Sound Barrier while also granting an on-demand Unstoppable
  buff to allies that may have bitten off more than they can chew. If you were a
  big fan of Reverse Amp, no need to worry, it stays on his kit in the form of a
  talent and has similar functionality! In response to the added power, we are
  slowing him down a little so he is not quite as frustrating to lock down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goal with this Chromie update is to create various degrees of success that Chromie can enjoy, so that she doesn't feel like quite the same all-or-nothing mage that she's historically been. Traditionally, Chromie has often required a hard counter to keep her in check or completely wrecked an opposing team, creating polarizing experiences.</p>
  
  <p>We're instituting a lot of changes that allow Chromie to get partial success
  with her Abilities (multiple Sand Blasts baseline, 3 blasts of Dragon's
  Breath), while also widening her toolkit (friendly Stasis, Basic Attack
  damage, PvE damage). While we're diversifying her kit, we also want to make
  sure that Chromie feels special, and we think that her Sand Echoes and
  predictive gameplay with Dragon's Breath are still unique parts of her that
  embody the feeling of artillery mage while still having moments of counter
  play for opponents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Due to Lunara's unique Movement Speed mechanics, our recent update to Blossom Swell was not as beneficial to Lunara as we had hoped. To address this, we are slightly reducing its bonus but allowing it to stack with other Movement Speed bonuses, including Lunara's trait, which should dramatically increase the total Movement Speed that she gets from this talent.</p>
