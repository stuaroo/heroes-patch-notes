<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>Leveling System and Rewards</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The out-of-game Leveling System has been reworked and many of the progression rewards it has to offer have been reorganized.
<ul>
<li>Cooperative and Versus game modes no longer need to be unlocked, and are now available from player level 1.</li>
<li>The XP Bonus earned by winning games in Versus Mode has been increased from 20,000 to 50,000 XP per win.</li>
<li>Rewards for leveling up are now as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Levels 2 and 4</strong>: 1,000 Gold each</li>
<li><strong>Level 6</strong>: Daily Quests</li>
<li><strong>Levels 8 and 10</strong>: Each unlock a new Hero Rotation Slot</li>
<li><strong>Level 12</strong>: 2,000 Gold</li>
<li><strong>Level 15</strong>: Unlocks the ability to use Artifacts and awards 2,000 Gold (See “Artifacts” section below.)</li>
<li><strong>Levels 20, 25, 30, and 35</strong>: 3,000 Gold each</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please note that following today’s patch, all partial progress toward the next player level will be lost.
<ul>
<li><em>For example: A player who was halfway to level 21 prior to the patch will be reset to player level 20.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Artifacts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Artifacts have been added to Heroes of the Storm, and can be used to modify a Hero’s starting stats prior to queuing for a match in any game mode.</li>
<li>Reach player level 15 to unlock the ability to purchase Artifacts and Artifact Slots using Gold.</li>
<li><strong>Artifact Slots</strong>
<ul>
<li>In order to use Artifacts in-game, they must first be equipped using Artifact Slots, which can be found just left of the “Ready” button on the Hero Select screen.</li>
<li>There are three types of Artifacts and Artifact slots: Gem, Relic, and Trinket
<ul>
<li>The Gem slot is automatically unlocked for free at level 15</li>
<li>The Relic and Trinket slots can be purchased in any order directly from the Hero Select screen, and cost 2,000 Gold each to unlock.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click an Artifact slot to bring up a list of Artifacts that can be equipped in that slot.
<ul>
<li>Up to 3 Artifacts can be selected for a match, but only one Artifact of each type (Gem, Relic, and Trinket) can be equipped at a time, so choose wisely!</li>
<li>Artifacts can be re-selected between games on the Hero Select screen.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Artifact Ranks</strong>
<ul>
<li>The higher an Artifact’s Rank, the stronger its in-game effects become.
<ul>
<li>Individual Artifacts can be purchased directly from the Hero Select screen, starting at 100 Gold for Rank 1.</li>
<li>Additional Ranks can be purchased up to a maximum of Rank 10 for each Artifact, and the cost increases by 100 Gold for each Rank purchased after the first.
<ul>
<li><em>Ex: Rank 2 costs 200 Gold, Rank 3 costs 300, and so on.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Free Gold for Artifacts!</strong>
<ul>
<li>All Tech Alpha accounts which achieved player level 5 or above prior to today’s patch have been granted a large amount of Gold in order to help test the new Artifact system.</li>
<li>The higher a player’s level, the more Gold has been granted for Artifact play testing.
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 30+: 75,000 Gold</strong></li>
<li><strong>Levels 20 - 29: 35,000 Gold</strong></li>
<li><strong>Levels 5 - 19: 10,000 Gold</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/14833869">Check out our recent blog post</a> for complete information on the Artifact System.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Levels and Rewards</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hero Levels</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hero Quests have been reworked and renamed to Hero Levels.
<ul>
<li>Previously, players were required to complete Versus matches in order to progress through Hero Quests and unlock the rewards they had to offer.</li>
<li>Now, however, experience points earned by playing matches in Cooperative or Versus modes count toward player level and Hero level progress alike.</li>
<li>All Heroes begin at level 1and can be individually leveled up to a maximum of 10.</li>
<li>Each new Hero level achieved will unlock rewards such as Talents, Gold, Skin variations, Portraits, and much more!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please Note that Hero Quests which were already complete prior to today’s patch have not been lost.
<ul>
<li>Instead, previously completed Hero Quests now count toward the current Hero Leveling System.
<ul>
<li><em>For example: If a Hero’s first Quest had already been completed prior to today’s patch, that Hero will begin at level 2.</em></li>
<li><em>Furthermore, if all six of a Hero’s Quests had already been completed, that Hero will begin at level 7 following the patch.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a Hero Quest was only partially complete prior to today’s patch, progress toward that Quest has been reset.
<ul>
<li><em>For example: If a Hero’s second Quest was only halfway complete prior to the patch, progress will be reset, and that Hero will begin at level 2.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Talents and Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Talents are no longer unlocked all at once by reaching player level 8 with the Leveling System.</li>
<li>Instead, Heroic Abilities and Talents are now unlocked on a per-Hero basis by playing and leveling up each Hero individually.
<ul>
<li>A level 1 Hero now starts with two Talents available at each tier of in-game Talent selection, and one Heroic Ability.</li>
<li>A Hero’s second Heroic Ability can be unlocked by reaching level 2.</li>
<li>Hero level 3 grants 6 additional talents for that Hero, one at each tier.</li>
<li>Level 4 unlocks all remaining Talent choices for that Hero.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hero Master Portraits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Hero Portraits are now unlocked by achieving level 6 with each Hero.</li>
<li>Master Portraits have been added to the game
<ul>
<li>Reach Hero level 9 to unlock a Hero’s Master Portrait, which can be used to further show off expertise with that Hero.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Master Skins</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Master Skins have been added to the Technical Alpha, and are the ultimate way to show off prowess with a Hero.
<ul>
<li>Unlock the ability to purchase a Hero’s Master Skin by reaching level 10 with that Hero.</li>
<li>Master Skins can be purchased for 10,000 each.</li>
<li>Just like any other Skin, each Hero’s Master Skin comes with two variations, which can be used to further customize that Hero’s appearance in-game!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>For a complete breakdown on Hero levels and rewards in this patch, please <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/14845424">read our recent Progression System blog</a>.</em></li>
</ul>

<li>Many aspects of the Player Profile have been reworked.</li>
<li>To access the Player Profile, click on the Hero portrait found in the top right corner of the Home screen.
<ul>
<li>Player Profiles can also be viewed on the Hero Select screen by right clicking the selected Hero, and then clicking View Profile.</li>

<li>Current player level and Hero portrait are now located at the top of the profile screen.</li>
<li>Several tabs have been added to the left-hand side which can be used to navigate the Player Profile.

<li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Can be used to view which Leveling System Rewards have already been earned, and which are yet to be unlocked.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Quests:</strong> Select this tab to keep an eye on which Daily Quests are currently available for completion.</li>
<li>The <strong>Profile Summary</strong> and <strong>Match History</strong> tabs have been <strong>disabled</strong> during Tech Alpha testing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>End-of-Game</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A navigation bar has been added to the End-of-Game screen which features four new tabs: Summary, Stats, Quests, and Rewards.
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Directly following the end of a match, players will now land immediately on the End-of-Game screen’s Summary tab.</li>
<li>This tab displays Hero and player level progression, as well as upcoming rewards for each, and any experience points or Gold earned from the previous match.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stats</strong>
<ul>
<li>Displays the End-of-Game Score screen as seen in previous versions of the Tech Alpha, which details takedowns, deaths, and Battleground mechanics earned by each player during the previous match.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lists all of the Daily Quests that are currently available for completion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Displays all of the rewards earned from the previous match.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>More information on the new End-of-Game screen can be found in <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/14845424/">our recent blog on Progression System updates</a>.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Select</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Skins, Mounts, and Heroes can now be purchased directly from the Hero Select screen.</li>
<li><strong>Skins</strong>
<ul>
<li>Click the Skins button in the lower left corner of the Hero Select screen to view all Skins and Skin variations for the selected Hero, and quickly switch between them.</li>
<li>If the selected Skin has not been unlocked, it can be purchased using real money directly from the Skins panel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Click the Mounts button to view all Mounts and Mount variations in the game, and quickly switch between them.</li>
<li>If the selected Mount has not been unlocked, it can be purchased using real money directly from the Mounts panel.
<ul>
<li>Please note that in order to view or purchase a Mount, a Hero must be selected that has the ability to use Mounts in-game.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hero Info</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Select a Hero, and then click the Hero Info button to view more detailed information on that Hero.
<ul>
<li>The selected Hero’s current level, role, and difficulty are displayed at the top of the Hero Info panel.</li>
<li>The Hero Info panel now features three tabs along the top which can be clicked to view detailed information on each of the following: Abilities, Heroic Abilities, and Talents.</li>
<li>If the selected Hero has not been unlocked, it can be purchased using Gold or real money directly from the Hero Info panel.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Artifact slots have been added to the bottom of the Hero Select screen between the Hero Info and Ready buttons.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Earning Gold</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Gold is now awarded upon completing matches in Cooperative and Versus game modes.
<ul>
<li>Each Cooperative mode win now awards 10 Gold.</li>
<li>Versus matches now grant 10 Gold per loss, and 40 Gold per win.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Daily Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Can now be completed in Cooperative mode!</li>
<li>All Daily Quests now award 200 Gold upon completion, but no longer grant experience points.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Radial Ping Menu</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Radial Ping Menu, accessed by pressing the G or Alt key and holding down the left mouse button, has received several improvements:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ping Menu Display</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Radial Ping Menu now fades in over 0.5 seconds, but will display immediately if the cursor is dragged outside the menu during that time.</li>
<li>After the Radial Ping Menu fades in, a cancel button is created at its center and can be used to close the menu without issuing a ping.
<ul>
<li>If the center of the Ping Menu is selected before the cancel button is created, a normal ping will be issued.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mouse Cursor</strong>
<ul>
<li>The mouse cursor now remains visible on-screen while using the Radial Ping Menu, and a line is now drawn from the center point of the menu to the cursor.</li>
<li>If the Radial Ping Menu is accessed while the cursor is at the edge of the screen, the menu will still partially display so that pings can still be issued.</li>
<li>After a ping is issued using the Radial Ping Menu, the mouse cursor will no longer be moved back to the ping location.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
