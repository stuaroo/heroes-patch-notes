<p>We’ve brought Heroes of the Storm offline for a period of extended maintenance today in order to bring you a brand new Closed Beta patch!

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Reconnect System has received several improvements, which should help players more quickly rejoin in-progress Heroes matches from which they’ve disconnected. The Reconnect System will continue to undergo evaluation going forward, and further improvements will be implemented as necessary with future updates.</em></li>
<li>Mac users can now find screenshots at the following location:
<ul>
<li>Library/Application Support/Blizzard/Heroes of the Storm/Screenshots</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Though Team League is not available with today’s patch, those who have achieved Player Level 40 will earn a new progression reward which indicates that they are eligible to compete in Team League. This reward will be displayed in Player Profiles, Quest Logs, and endgame Score Screens, but Team League will remain disabled until a future update is released.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In-game Communication</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It is now possible to view recent in-game chat messages by opening the chat box to type a new message. Only the most recent messages will be displayed in this way. Additional improvements will arrive with future updates.</li>
<li>The following items have been temporarily disabled for further evaluation and improvements:
<ul>
<li>The Emote Menu (Y).</li>
<li>The ability to send “GG” chat messages to opponents in the moments after a Core is destroyed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quest Log</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A new Quest Log button has been added to the lower-right portion of the bottom navigation bar, next to the Friends List button.
<ul>
<li>The Quest Log will be locked prior to earning the Daily Quests reward at Player Level 6.</li>
<li>Click the Quest Log button to view active Daily Quest progression, Player Level progress, as well as the next progression reward.</li>
<li>The Quest Log will also be automatically displayed upon each login, which should help players more easily keep track of their Daily Quest and progression reward progress.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Player Profile</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Player Profile screen has received an overhaul.
<ul>
<li>The Daily Quests tab has been removed.</li>
<li>The Profile Summary tab has been enabled.
<ul>
<li>Players can use this tab to view general information about their Heroes of the Storm account, such as: Recent Victory, Most Played Heroes, Total Hero Level, Ranked Play win-rates, games played with each Hero role, and much more!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Rewards tab has been renamed to Player Progression
<ul>
<li>This tab can be used to view current Player Level, progress toward the next level, and all Player Level progression rewards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Hero Progress tab has been renamed to Hero Collection
<ul>
<li>Hero Progress has been visually reworked, allowing many more Heroes, their current Hero Levels, and progress toward the next level, to be displayed on each page of the Hero Collection tab.</li>
<li>Additionally, clicking any Hero portrait on the Hero Collection tab will bring up that Hero’s 3D model, as well as detailed information about its current Hero level and reward progress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Match History tab has been enabled.
<ul>
<li>Select this tab to view a list of recently played Heroes of the Storm matches.</li>
<li>The game mode, Hero, and Battleground selected, as well as the game’s result, and a timestamp will be displayed for each match in the list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Statistics tab has been added.
<ul>
<li>Players can use this tab to view additional statistics about their performance in Heroes of the Storm, such as: Heroes they’ve scored the most takedowns or received the most deaths with, total games played, and Battleground win-rates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Portrait tab has been added.
<ul>
<li>Portrait Selection has been moved from its previous location to this tab, making it easier than ever for players to find and choose among the portraits they’ve already earned, or simply browse through the portrait rewards they have yet to unlock.</li>
<li>Hover the mouse over any Portrait to display a tooltip that explains how it can be earned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Please Note that some of the Player Profile statistics mentioned above will not contain data for games played prior to today’s patch. However, statistics for games played after the patch will be properly tracked.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Penalties for Leaving Games</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The tracking and penalties for leaving in-progress Quick Match and Hero League games before they are finished have been changed:
<ul>
<li>Leaving multiple Hero League or Quick Match games without reconnecting will now flag the player to receive the following penalties:
<ul>
<li>The flagged player will be disallowed from queuing for Hero League games until a Quick Match game is played to completion.
<ul>
<li>Leaving additional games early will cause the number of Quick Match games required to increase.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When queuing for Quick Match games, the flagged player will be teamed up with other flagged players who have similarly left games early.</li>
<li>The system will track players’ recent games. If a player has not left any games prematurely for some time, then leaving a single game (for reasons outside of that player’s control) will not trigger these penalties.</li>
<li>When a player who is flagged for leaving games early joins a party, the entire party will also become subject to these penalties.
<ul>
<li><em>Please note that <strong>this will not cause</strong> <strong>party members to be flagged individually</strong>. These penalties will be lifted from the party once the flagged player either completes the requirements noted above, or leaves the party.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players penalized in this way can earn back the ability to play in Hero League, and be matched with non-leaving teammates. Simply play the assigned number of Quick Match games to completion (and stop leaving games).</li>
<li>Leaving a Hero League game during Draft Mode will now only penalize and flag the player who left the draft, and will no longer penalize the rest of that player’s party members.
<ul>
<li>In addition, the flagged player will still lose a significant number of Ranked Points upon leaving Draft Mode.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
