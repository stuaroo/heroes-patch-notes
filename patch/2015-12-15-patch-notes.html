<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="heroes">Heroes</h3>

<h4 id="tassadar">Tassadar</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plasma Shield (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can now be cast on allies located in the Hall of Storms</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="artanis">Artanis</h4>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack range increased by 25%</li>
<li><strong>Phase Prism (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Range and speed have each been increased by 15%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Artanis was having a harder time sticking to
  opponents than we’d like. This was hurting his ability to disrupt the enemy
  team and his ability to survive. We feel that a slight increase to his base
  kit will help alleviate this issue, while maintaining a lot of the playstyle
  (and counterplay) that we currently enjoy. The increased range on Phase Prism
  and his Basic Attacks should help him feel better to play, and help him more
  successfully fulfill his aggressive Warrior role.</p>
  
  <p>These changes are intentionally slight, as we feel Artanis is very close to
  being extremely powerful in today’s game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage increased from 110 to 120</li>
<li>Base Health increased from 3360 to 3528</li>
<li>Base Health Regeneration increased from 7 to 7.35 per second</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Cho’gall’s win rate has been trending up since
  his release, but it is still a bit lower than we’d like. We have plans to
  improve Cho’gall with Talent changes in the future, but we wanted to give him
  a small buff before then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<p><strong>Battlegrounds</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Soul Eaters and their summoned minions have received Health and damage updates to better reflect scaling changes that were implemented with the <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19953593">most recent major Heroes of the Storm patch</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroes and Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Azmodan’s Globe of Annihilation will now deal the correct amount of damage while under the effects of Black Pool and the Taste for Blood Talent.
<ul>
<li>This fix will also resolve incorrect damage amounts for similar Talent interactions, such as Muradin’s Storm Bolt with the Sledgehammer and Perfect Storm Talents, as well as Falstad’s Gathering Storm and Overdrive Talents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause Leoric’s Drain Hope to end prematurely.</li>
<li>Fixed several situations in which summoned units could return directly to lane rather than continuing to attack nearby enemies while capturing a Mercenary Camp.</li>
<li>Tychus’ Hero model will no longer disappear after capturing a Fort on the Towers of Doom Battleground.</li>
<li>Artanis’ Purifier Beam will no longer track Murky back to his Egg if Murky was killed just as the Ability was cast.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause Brightwing’s Phase Shield to be applied to Cho’gall inconsistently.</li>
<li>Diagonally placed Shrubs will no longer sometimes fail to properly hide a Hero within.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which could allow Cho’gall to regenerate Health after using Consuming Blaze on certain destructible objects.</li>
<li>Punishers on the Infernal Shrines Battleground will no longer fly outside the playable area after leaping into Zeratul’s Void Prison.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Allied Minion status bars will no longer appear green when they are missing Health.</li>
<li>Resolved some cases in which Hero League games could incorrectly flag players to receive leaver penalties.</li>
<li>Pressing the Enter key while casting certain Abilities will no longer cause the key to behave as though it is stuck. </li>
</ul>
