for more information.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blackheart's Bay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot a cannonball at 2 nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage, slowing them by 70% for 1.5 seconds, and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot 5 missiles at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage per missile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cursed Hollow</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 3 seconds, the Core will spawn a Curse under a nearby enemy Hero. If they are Cursed, they take 5% maximum Health as damage and their Armor is reduced by 75 for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dragonshire</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core will throw 2 boulders at a nearby enemy Hero. Heroes hit are turned to stone, damaged for 5% of their maximum Health, and Stunned for 1.75 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Garden of Terror</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core shoots a seed under a nearby enemy Hero. When the seed explodes, Heroes inside are Polymorphed for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core fires 2 volleys of missiles around it, dealing 5% maximum Health to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sky Temple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 23 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 sets of 6 tornadoes which swirl around it, dealing 25 damage to enemy Heroes and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core will shoot a Death Wave, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volskaya</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core shoots 3 Rocket Fists at nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 150 damage and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warhead Junction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 18 seconds, the Core launches a Nuke at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 30% maximum health to enemy Heroes hit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Mastery Rings - Tier 3</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Get ready to show off your dedication to your favorite Heroes with the next level of Hero Mastery Rings! These new rings become purchasable once a Hero reaches level 50 and you already own the first and second rings for that Hero.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A.I.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. trees have been refactored in order to reduce conflicts between the tactical and goal systems.</li>
<li>Agents will attempt to stage and wait for backup around objectives before attempting to contest.</li>
<li>Disconnected players will have their A.I. return to base and remain there unless they are pinged to follow. 
<ul>
<li>Follow behavior is the same for disconnected player A.I. and normal A.I.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will attempt to fight while remaining close to their follow target, leashing back if they wander too far away.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will mount or use their Hearthstone if their follow target uses their mount or Hearthstone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting A.I. Healing Well goal health threshold from 75% to 60%.</li>
<li>Bringing an A.I. who is on follow close enough to Doubloon turn-in on Blackheart's Bay, Soul Gem turn-in on Tomb of the Spider Queen, or a healing fountain will cause the A.I. to interact with them appropriately if they are able.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create your favorite talent builds</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can pick their favorite talents on the talent panel from Hero select or draft screen.</li>

<li>Players can create up to 3 builds per each Hero and can activate one build at a time.</li>
<li>To switch to a different build, click the build buttons shown on the top of the talent panel.</li>
<li>If any significant change happens to a talent tier due to a balance patch, the selection for the tier will be reset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Share your favorite builds</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can generate a hyperlink for a talent build by clicking the cog menu next to talent build buttons on the Hero select screen.</li>
<li>If you paste this link on the chat, it shows as a hyperlink in the chat history.</li>

<li>By right clicking the link, you can copy the link to your clipboard or directly save it to your Hero's corresponding build slots.</li>
<li>The format of the talent hyperlink is as follows. [T1231231,Lucio]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>In-Game &amp; End of the match screen</strong>
<ul>
<li>A favorited talent will display a favorite icon on top of it.</li>
<li>You can switch the build in the middle of the game based on your strategy.</li>
<li>For the future tiers, you can adjust your favorites by clicking the talent button in the same way you would do in the Hero select screen.</li>
<li>All changes made in game are saved.</li>
<li>After game ends, you can use the cog menu on the talent tab to copy other players' talent builds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

<h4 id="xul">Xul</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2200 to 2080.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.58 to 4.33.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>
