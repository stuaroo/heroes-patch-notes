<h3 id="new-hero-auriel">New Hero: Auriel</h3>

<p>It is through the archangel Auriel that the power of hope flows into the
fabric of creation. Her eternal light illuminates even the darkest souls.
Seeking harmony in all things, she is a mediator, a counselor, and when the
need arises, a fearless warrior.</p>

<p><strong>Trait</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bestow Hope (D)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Activate to bestow an allied Hero with Hope. Damage that Hero deals while they are nearby will cause you to store Energy. Bestow Hope can only be active on one Hero at a time.</li>
<li>Passive: 40% of the damage you deal to Heroes and 8% of your damage dealt to non-Heroes is stored as Energy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Damages enemies in a wide arc and deals bonus damage to enemies caught in the center.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ray of Hope (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consume all of your stored Energy to Heal allied Heroes in the target area. The amount of Healing done is based on the amount of Energy spent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Detainment Strike (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deals damage to the first enemy Hero struck and knocks them back. If the target collides with terrain, they are also Stunned for 1.25 seconds and take additional damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crystal Aegis (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Place an allied Hero into Stasis for 2 seconds. Upon expiration, Crystal Aegis explodes, damaging nearby enemies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resurrect (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allied Heroes leave behind a spirit on death. Channel on a spirit for 3 seconds to bring that ally back to life with 50% of their maximum Health at their death location.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gravity Crush (E)
<ul>
<li>Removed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sun King’s Fury (W)
<ul>
<li>Moved to level 7</li>
<li>New Functionality: Now increases the damage of Living Bombs that spread to enemy Heroes by 30%</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NEW TALENT: Arcane Dynamo (Passive)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Casting a Basic Ability causes you to gain 3% Ability Power for 5 seconds, stacking up to a total of 15% Ability Power</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Arcane Power (Active)
<ul>
<li>Removed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NEW TALENT: Flamethrower (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increases the range of Flamestrike by 40%. When you hit two or more enemy Heroes, reduce the cooldown of Flamestrike by 4 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> As we had mentioned in previous patches, we wanted
  to make a niche for Kael’thas as an area-of-effect mage who punishes teams
  that clump together. Our earlier changes to him succeeded in helping his
  talent diversity, but we failed in pointing him enough in the direction of an
  AoE mage. We’ve decided to cut Gravity Crush and change Sun King’s Fury to be
  a mechanic more fitting of our intended design for Kael’thas.  </p>
  
  <p>To replace Sun King’s Fury at Level 16 we’ve created Arcane Dynamo, which
  rewards Kael’thas players for spacing out their abilities and properly
  balancing their Mana consumption. We also removed the generic talent Arcane
  Power, and replaced it with Flamethrower, a finisher talent for Flamestrike
  oriented builds.</p>

<h4 id="tracer">Tracer</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slipstream (E)
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces the cooldown of Recall by 2 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spatial Echo (Q)
<ul>
<li>New Functionality: Hero Takedowns now grant two charges of Blink</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sticky Bomb (R)
<ul>
<li>Slow amount increased from 60 to 70%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bullet Spray (W)
<ul>
<li>Melee radius increase reduced from 50 to 40%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Total Recall (E)
<ul>
<li>Now also increases the cooldown of Recall by 8 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> For the most part, Tracer’s talents are in a
  pretty healthy spot, but we had a few outliers that we wanted to fix -
  particularly Spatial Echo and Total Recall. The intent of Spatial Echo was to
  give Tracer a moment of power in comparison to the other two talents on her
  tier, which are more generally useful and help her have more Blink casts
  throughout a game. While its win rate was in line with other talents, its pick
  rate was dominating the tier, and we weren’t happy with how much it let Tracer
  use her Recall as a "get out of jail free card" due to the guaranteed blinks
  that she would always have afterwards. Now she can still have the same moment
  of power, but she will have to get in and get the kill in order to Recall out
  to safety.  </p>
  
  <p>Total Recall is a great fantasy hit for us, but it comes at the cost of giving
  Tracer something that she really wants in the form of self-sustain. We’re
  adding the downside of increasing the cooldown of Recall to the talent in
  order to make players think a little more about when they want to take the
  talent.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clockwerk Steam Fists (Q)

<li>New Functionality: Quest - Basic Attacks increase the duration of active Rock-It! Turrets by 2 seconds. Reward - After earning a total increase of 600 seconds, permanently reduce the charge cooldown of Rock-It! Turret by 3 seconds.</li>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Zombie Wall (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Abilities that allow Heroes to move through units can no longer be used to escape Zombie Wall (Valla’s Vault, E.T.C.’s Powerslide, Sonya’s Whirlwind, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Nazeebo has been around for quite a long time.
  Back in the early days of Heroes, there were very few that could escape his
  Zombie Wall, and it was something that everyone in the Nexus greatly feared.
  Since then we have added a lot more heroes with various mobility options that
  allow them to get out. We’re making a change to give his Zombies collision,
  which will greatly reduce the number of heroes who can easily escape them.</p>
