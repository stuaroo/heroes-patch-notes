<h3 id="new-battleground">New Battleground</h3>

<p><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This three-lane Battleground features three Infernal Shrines that will periodically gather power. Only one Shrine will gather power at any given time, and either team can activate it to unleash its might.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arcane</strong> – The Punisher summons beams of arcane energy which rotate in a circular motion, and deal massive damage to enemy targets they pass through.</li>
<li><strong>Frozen</strong> – The Punisher calls forth frigid ice shards, which explode after a short delay, dealing damage and freezing enemies in place for a short time.</li>
<li><strong>Mortar</strong> – The Punisher launches a stream of firebombs high into the air, which explode and deal damage to any enemies they strike upon landing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Game Server Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players may now select which game server they’d like to play on by selecting it from the Preferred Game Server dropdown on the Language and Region options menu.
<ul>
<li>This setting will default to Best Match, but players may wish to change this if they notice connection issues when playing on a specific server.
<ul>
<li><em>Please note: As we continue to improve and expand our game sites, Best Match will provide the best play experience for most players. If you are not experiencing issues, it is highly recommend that you leave this set to Best Match.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If players in a party have conflicting server preferences, the server that is most commonly selected among the party’s members will be used.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Player Reporting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Report Categories</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reporting Options have been reworked, and now include categories for Abusive Chat, AFK/Non-Participation, and Intentional Feeding.</li>

<ul>
<li>All players’ Hero and Team League ranks have been reset with today’s update.
<ul>
<li><em>Please Note: Matchmaking ratings have not been reset.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A new placement system has been added
<ul>
<li>All players must now play 20 placement matches in order to receive an initial ranking for Hero League or Team League.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19829511">our recent blog on Ranked Play Updates</a> to learn more about Placement Matches.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Hero League is now limited to a maximum party size of four players.</li>

<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Team League draft lobbies will still use the First Come First Served draft format.</li>
<li>Team League will still use a separate matchmaking rating (MMR) from Hero League.
<ul>
<li>However, because Team League parties do not have static rosters, Team League MMR will now functions much like it does for Hero League. This means that each player’s Team League MMR is based on their own individual performance in Team League matches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19829511">our recent blog on Ranked Play Updates</a> to learn more about Placement Matches, as well as Hero and Team League updates.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Please note: Elite A.I. development is not yet complete, and improvements are slated to arrive with a future game update.</em></li>
<li>A.I. teammates will mirror the difficulty selected for A.I. opponents.</li>
<li>When playing in a party, only the party leader may change the A.I. difficulty setting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When attempting to find a Versus A.I. game with human allies, the matchmaker will work to find other players who have selected the same A.I. difficulty level.
<ul>
<li>If it takes too long to find a suitable match, the matchmaker will expand its search to include difficulty levels above and below the player’s selection.</li>
<li>If the human players on a team had selected a variety of A.I. difficulties, an A.I. opponent of each selected difficulty will be used for that game.
<ul>
<li><em>For example: If two players selected Adept A.I. and three selected Veteran, the game will be filled with two adept and three veteran A.I. opponents.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design-amp-gameplay">Design &amp; Gameplay</h3>

<p><strong>Ability Power Gains</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> This change was aimed at removing odd gameplay
  where a Nazeebo player may actually want to sacrifice his or her Gargantuan
  for a more powerful one. This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a
  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as
  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term
  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current
  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete
  duration of the effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>To clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:
<ul>
<li>For permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Abathur's Monstrosity</li>
<li>Nazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Jaina's Water Elemental</li>
<li>Sgt. Hammer's Blunt Force Gun</li>
<li>Tychus' Drakken Laser Drill</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus Effects from Kills</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> This change will not have a major impact on
  today’s gameplay and was mostly done for consistency on how these type of
  talents worked. In the future, it may allow us to develop Battlegrounds with
  many small minions (think Haunted Mines) and not have to worry about special
  casing Seasoned Marksman so it doesn’t get out of control.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Talents and Abilities that gain bonus effects from kills will now only trigger from Minions and Mercenaries, and will no longer gain benefit from killing neutral Mercenaries, map event creatures, summoned units, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When Immortals that are battling at the center of the Battleground swap locations for the first time, the Heaven Immortal will now always travel to right, and the Hell Immortal will always travel to the left.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A small number of Tomb games tend to run
  significantly longer than intended, so we altered the scaling of the Spider
  mechanic to prevent drawn out stalemates in the late game. Our hope is to see
  shorter matches overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Increased the damage and Health scaling of Webweavers and their minions by 50% past the 15 minute mark.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>

<p><strong>Bolt of the Storm</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We love this talent and think it can create a lot
  of really interesting moments, but the cooldown was just too short. At 70
  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players
  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use
  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased
  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic
  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cleanse</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We didn’t like the gameplay of casting Cleanse
  preemptively on a target that is about to be CC’ed. For example, you see
  Butcher charging your Valla, and right before impact you use Cleanse on Valla,
  allowing her to immediately Vault away. The change also prevents healers from
  cleansing themselves preemptively, providing a guaranteed target if the
  opposing team has only secured one Cleanse. As a side note, the original
  reason the Unstoppable functionality was available in the first place, was to
  help alleviate some persistent CC effects like Putrid Bile. We didn’t want you
  to cleanse a Putrid Bile only to have the slow immediately reapply.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>No longer makes the target Unstoppable for 1 second</li>
<li>Now adds Relentless to the target for 2 seconds (50% shorter CC duration)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focused Attacks</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> This could be viewed as a buff or nerf depending
  on how players perceive it. You can still reduce the cooldown by attacking
  Minions, but won’t accidently waste a burst of damage on an unintended target.
  This talent will no longer be as effective at sieging, but it should be
  significantly better at harassing in lane. We will continue to monitor the
  talent, and tune as necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The increased damage effect will now only trigger when hitting Heroes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gathering Power</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Gathering Power was simply too good and was
  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead
  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too
  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,
  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much
  longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help
  act as a ‘check point’.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The 5% starting Ability Power has been removed</li>
<li>Percentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1%</li>
<li>Instead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Imposing Presence</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Statistically, it was almost never wrong to choose
  Imposing Presence. With this nerf, it’s still a great counter in the right
  situation, and as a result, we’re hoping we’ll see more play from our Basic
  Attack assassins.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Attack Speed slow reduced from 50% to 40%</li>
<li>The Attack Speed slow will now be removed when attacking a target that has not learned the Imposing Presence Talent</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenary Lord</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve combined the talent Superiority into
  Mercenary Lord, and removed the damage reduction from structures to prevent
  degenerative backdoor strategies. The combination of the damage reduction vs.
  Mercenaries and the ability to empower these Mercenaries felt like a logical
  pairing. We hope incorporating the two talents into one will make this level 4
  choice an enticing one, as the two talents separated had a low pick rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The functionality of the Superiority Talent has been rolled into Mercenary Lord, which is now available to the following Heroes at Level 4:
<ul>
<li>Anub'arak, Arthas, Azmodan, Gazlowe, Nazeebo, Sonya, Stitches, and The Lost Vikings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New combined functionality reads: Non-Boss Mercenaries near your Hero deal 50% more damage. Reduces damage taken from Minions and Mercenaries by 50%.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Seasoned Marksman</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Overall, we like the way Seasoned Marksman is
  playing but wanted to tune up its effectiveness to reward those able to secure
  a healthy number of takedowns, while simultaneously tuning the talent up due
  to prior changes. Ideally, this will become a great talent pick when facing
  The Lost Vikings or Murky players.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Stacks earned by killing enemy Heroes increased from 2 to 3</li>
<li>Only Minions, captured enemy Mercenaries, and Heroes will grant stacks upon death</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Superiority</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This Talent has been removed, and its functionality has been rolled into the revamped Mercenary Lord Talent</li>
</ul>

  it’s almost always a mistake to summon one of his Demons and waste your mana.
  With the new tuning, and the talent changes, the Demons become a legitimate
  option to use. The Demons start with much more damage than previously, but
  scale close to what they use to be at higher levels. For players who still
  plan to go the (Q) build, it’s mostly the same, but we’ve offered a few
  additional talent choices to make options that best fit your play style.

<h4 id="brightwing">Brightwing</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We like a lot of what the rework did for
  Brightwing, but overall her healing output went down more than intended. This
  change will give her back a big portion of the lost healing and should
  increase her total healing output (tab screen wise) by about 15-20%.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="malfurion">Malfurion</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Player feedback brought to our attention that this
  particular level 4 talent on Malfurion was an obvious trap at 20%. While we
  don’t want to give Malfurion a solid burst healing option, we agreed and have
  tuned this talent up to 50%. At 50%, and in a vacuum, this talent may still be
  undertuned, but it eventually adds up to a decent additional amount of
  healing. Over a sustained period of time, this additional 50% outpaces
  Protective Shield, for example.</p>

<h4 id="rehgar">Rehgar</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Bloodlust is rarely picked right now, but we feel
  like both Heroics are extremely powerful. Without changing anything massive,
  we’re simply reducing the CD of Bloodlust so it can be used more frequently.
  We believe if Basic Attack based heroes become more prevalent in the Meta,
  this Heroic could become dominant, so we’ll be taking a cautious approach.</p>

<h4 id="sonya">Sonya</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Overall, we’re looking to tune Sonya up slightly.
  With the health increases, she’ll be a bit more tanky. Previously, Whirlwind
  could be very frustrating to lane against if you didn’t have a stun. With the
  shift of less healing from minions and more from heroes, this will make Sonya
  less of a lane bully and more of an effective skirmisher.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Overall, our goal was to make Sanctification a
  viable Heroic for players. We increased its effectiveness and fixed a few bugs
  to make the ability more consistent. With the changes, Sanctification can
  become extremely powerful at countering Wombos or Hard Engage teams, making it
  an enticing choice over Judgement in certain situations.</p>
