<p>We just released a new patch for Heroes of the Storm, which brings a new Hero,
a new Battleground, User Interface improvements, and many balance changes to
the game. Check out the patch notes below.</p>

<h3 id="new-battleground-lost-cavern">New Battleground: Lost Cavern</h3>

<p><strong>Lost Cavern,</strong> a new Battleground featuring just <strong>one lane</strong> —and a whole lot of team fighting— is now available for play <strong>exclusively in Custom Games!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lost Cavern has no Mercenary Camps, and just one objective: Battle through the opposing Fort, Keep, and Core to claim victory.</li>
<li>Players cannot use Hearthstone and will not heal at the allied Hall of Storms.</li>
<li>Corridors on either side of the lane contain neutral Regeneration Globes, which will respawn regularly throughout the game.</li>
<li><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20064917"><em>Check out our recent blog to learn more about Lost Cavern</em></a>. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Display Settings</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes of the Storm now supports most 'ultrawide' 21:9 monitor resolutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hero Select</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Ready, Skins, Mount, Abilities, and Talents buttons on Hero Select have received additional visual polish.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Game Start Notification</strong>
<ul>
<li>If Heroes of the Storm is minimized, it will now automatically become the focus window when loading is finished and a match is about to begin.</li>
<li>If Heroes of the Storm is not the focus window (via ALT + TAB), it will now blink in the taskbar when loading is finished.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ranked Play</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bans have arrived!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hero bans have been added to draft mode for both Hero and Team League games.</li>
<li>All Ranked games will use the “Mid Ban” method during drafts, which features two ban rounds per team —one round before hero picks begin, and a second halfway through the draft.
<ul>
<li>The player with the highest matchmaking rating on each team will be automatically selected to issue bans.
<ul>
<li>Players selected to issue bans can be identified by a new crown icon, which will appear over the Hero portrait, and animates during each team’s turn to ban.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whichever team wins the coin toss before drafting begins will receive first ban and first pick.</li>
<li>The team that loses the coin toss will ban first during the second ban round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each team will have 45 seconds to ban a Hero during the first round, and 30 seconds during the second Ban round.
<ul>
<li>If no Hero is banned or highlighted before time expires, the ban will be skipped.</li>
<li>If a Hero is highlighted when time expires, that hero will be automatically banned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hero pick timers have been reduced from 45 to 30 seconds, but pick order has not been changed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Updated Ranked Requirements</strong>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Player Level requirements have been removed from ranked play, meaning that players no longer need to reach Level 30 in order to participate in Hero or Team League games.</li>
<li>Due to the addition of bans, Ranked play now requires that players have access to at least 14 Heroes who have reached Level 5 or higher in order to participate.
<ul>
<li>Weekly free-to-play rotation Heroes that have reached Level 5 or higher now count toward the minimum Hero requirement, and can also be selected for play in ranked games. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Those who have received penalties for leaving games will no longer be prevented from participating in Team League games —be sure to choose Team League allies carefully!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Draft Lobby</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Draft Lobby has received an overhaul and additional visual polish.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Upon entering a draft lobby, the upcoming Battleground’s name and art will be prominently displayed on screen, along with an audible callout.</li>
<li>The draft lobby has received updated background art.</li>
<li>Animated Hero models will now be displayed for each pick and ban.</li>
<li>Draft lobbies now feature animated Hero portraits.
<ul>
<li>Glow animations have been added to player slots, which will more clearly indicate who will be picking or banning during each turn.</li>
<li>Skin selections will now be visible on Hero models and in portraits in the draft lobby.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hero Selection has been visually reworked</strong>
<ul>
<li>A “Favorites” bar has been added in order to help players more easily find and select their most preferred Heroes during the draft phase.
<ul>
<li>To select Favorites, navigate to the Hero Collection tab in the Player Profile, and then drag and drop up to 8 Heroes into the new favorites bar at the top of the screen.</li>
<li>If no favorites have been manually selected, the Favorites bar will be automatically filled with the player’s 8 highest-level Heroes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click the new “Browse All” Heroes button to open a much larger Hero select pane, which features up to 48 heroes per page.</li>
<li>Heroes can now be sorted by role, and a search bar has been added which can be used to find heroes by name, universe, and other keywords.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Custom Games</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Several ban methods have been added for Custom Game Draft Lobbies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Change the Lobby Mode to Draft, and then use the new Ban Mode dropdown to choose which of the following ban methods to use during the upcoming draft:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Using Bans:</strong> Heroes cannot be banned in this mode.</li>
<li><strong>One ban:</strong> One ban round prior to Hero picks.</li>
<li><strong>Two bans:</strong> Two ban rounds that alternate teams before Hero picks begin.</li>
<li><strong>Mid Ban:</strong> Two ban rounds. One round before Hero picks begin, and another halfway through the draft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After selecting a Ban Mode, the Lobby Host may click the crown icons found on each player slot to designate which players on each team will issue Hero bans.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In-Game UI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hero Portrait</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can now right-click through the in-game Hero Portrait.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Death Recaps</strong>
<ul>
<li>Death Recap notifications will now be displayed on the left side of the screen upon being killed.
<ul>
<li>These notifications briefly summarize the cause of death, list the player’s killer, and the source of damage that scored the killing blow.</li>
<li>Click the notification to open a detailed Death Recap on the in-game Score Screen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players may view their most recent detailed Death Recap at any time by clicking the “Show the last Death Recap” button added near the bottom of the in-game Score Screen (TAB).
<ul>
<li>Detailed Death Recaps will display a graph of the player’s remaining Health over time, as well as all sources of incoming damage and healing, during the final moments leading to death.</li>
<li>The top three sources of incoming damage will appear at the top of the detailed Death Recap, along with the percentage of total damage dealt by each.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Score Screen</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Show Talents/Show Stats buttons on the in-game Score Screen (TAB) have been replaced by three new buttons on the in-game score screen: Stats, Talents, and Show Last Death Recap</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hotkeys</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hotkey settings can now be accessed directly from the Main Menu by pressing Escape and clicking the new Hotkey button.</li>
<li><strong>Hotkey Profiles</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new “Show in Folder” button has been added next to the Selected Profile dropdown, which can be used to find Hotkey Settings files.
<ul>
<li>These files can be shared with friends or transferred to other Heroes accounts.</li>
<li>Multiple Hotkey Profiles can be created, but only the profile that is currently in use will be cloud saved.
<ul>
<li>A cloud saved Hotkey Profile will be available for use when logged into the same Heroes of the Storm account while using a different computer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Basic Hotkeys</strong>
<ul>
<li>Talent hotkeys have been moved from the Advanced tab to the Basic tab.</li>
<li>Hotkeys on the Basic tab can now be rebound to mouse buttons. </li>
<li>Players can now rebind the hotkey for queuing commands using the new dropdown menu at the top of the Basic Hotkeys menu.
<ul>
<li>The queue commands hotkey will default to Shift, but can also be changed to Ctrl, Alt, or None.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advanced Hotkeys</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hotkeys for self-casting Abilities can now be rebound under the new “Hero Abilities (Self Cast)” category.</li>
<li>Hotkeys for overriding Quick Cast settings can now be set under the new “Hero Abilities (Quick Cast)” and “Hero Abilities (Quick Cast On Release)” categories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quick Cast for Individual Abilities</strong>
<ul>

<li>Use the new dropdown menu under the “Per Ability Quick Cast Settings” header to switch among Heroes, or Battleground Objectives such as the Dragon Knight and Garden Terror.
<ul>
<li>After selecting a Hero, use the dropdown lists on the right side of the screen to change quick cast settings for that Hero’s Abilities and Activated Talents.</li>
<li>Most Abilities can be set to <strong>Off</strong>, <strong>On</strong>, <strong>On Release</strong>, or <strong>Use Global Setting</strong></li>
<li>Quick Cast Settings for Abilities and Activated Talents that are already cast instantly cannot be changed.
<ul>
<li>Instant Abilities that are not targeted no longer follow the player’s Global Quick Cast setting, and will now be cast immediately on pressing down the associated hotkey, instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Abilities and Talents that are shared across multiple Heroes, such as Basic Attack and Cleanse, will also use shared Quick Cast settings for those Abilities and Talents.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Those who prefer to use the same Quick Cast setting for most actions may still do so using the “Global Settings” dropdown at the top of the Quick Cast Settings menu. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Dragon Shire</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon Knight</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now immune to Attack Speed slows applied by attacks from enemy Forts and Keeps</li>
<li><strong>Savage Charge (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Targets punted by Savage Charge will no longer be stunned after landing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We want to encourage players to be really
  aggressive and feel like they can tank shots from Forts and Keeps when
  piloting the Dragon Knight. The Attack Speed slows from these Structures were
  discouraging players from tanking the structures, and often led to a Dragon
  Knight having less than the desired impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Garden of Terror</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Garden Terror (Player Controlled)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage reduced by 15%</li>
<li>Basic Attacks now deal 50% damage to nearby non-Heroic enemies</li>
<li>Basic Attacks now instantly kill Minions</li>
<li><strong>Overgrowth (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer affects Minions or Mercenaries</li>
<li>No longer deals damage to Structures</li>
<li>Garden Terror now deals 100% bonus damage to Structures disabled by Overgrowth</li>
<li>Maximum duration increased from 15 to 25 seconds</li>
<li>Cooldown increased from 15 to 25 seconds</li>
<li>Health increased by 100%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We don’t like the common (and, usually, optimal)
  gameplay tactic of playing hit-and-run with the Garden Terror. Chasing it as
  it ran between lanes dropping Overgrowths wasn’t enjoyable for the defending
  team, and didn’t fit the spirit of what the Garden Terror was intended to do.
  The new functionality attempts to create a larger “moment” when Overgrowth is
  placed, as it gives a huge bonus—provided the Garden Terror can attack—and
  also makes killing the Overgrowth a bigger deal. Overall, we think Garden
  Terror combat will be more interesting and tactical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Arcane Power</strong></p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We want to improve counter-pick talents like Block
  that are meant to be strong against certain hero types. We’re hoping that
  these kinds of Talents will have a more meaningful impact in games in which
  they are picked, and that there are more situations where the enemy team’s
  composition drives intelligent Talent choices.  </p>
  
  <p>Other effects similar to Block have been evaluated on a case-by-case basis for
  all Heroes, with some gaining increased Block damage reduction, while others
  stayed at 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Dampen Magic</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This Talent has been redesigned</li>
<li>Dampen Magic charges now cause all incoming Ability Damage to be reduced by 50% for 1 second</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Similar to Block, Dampen Magic is the first of
  many efforts we will be making to create more meaningful counter-pick Talents
  (in this case, against spell casters). We found that the original iteration of
  Dampen Magic did not truly fulfill its purpose of mitigating spell damage due
  to how many spell effects are done with incremental damage. This buff should
  make the Talent more universally viable against enemy spells.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Illidan has had many problems with his Talent tree
  that have often led to one viable choice at each tier. The goal of the Talent
  system is to provide meaningful and tactical decisions, and this just hasn’t
  been the case with Illidan. His new Talent tree puts damage, survivability,
  and utility options within their own tiers, and allows you to customize how
  you want to do those things based upon your opponents and your preferred
  playstyle.  </p>
  
  <p>We also wanted to really embrace the skill cap required to play Illidan while
  not making him too difficult to pick up and learn. Some of his Talents are now
  harder to pull off, but offer much higher bonuses if you’re able to use them
  effectively. If those aren’t for you, then you can always pick the Talents
  that are more consistent and easier to use.  </p>
  
  <p>Finally, we buffed Illidan’s base kit to make up for losing some of the
  Talents that he was previously relying on. Overall, we think Illidan is now a
  lot more fun to play, and that you won’t know exactly what your Talent build
  will be until you’re in a game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve removed Bolt of the Storm from Jaina because
  it overcame a core weakness of hers that we think is essential to maintain:
  her lack of mobility. While there was always the potential for big plays with
  Bolt, we found that it was more often used as a “get out of jail free card”
  that helped make up for sloppy positioning after reaching level 20. We’re in
  the process of evaluating whether or not Bolt should be available to a number
  of Heroes, which is why it was also removed it from Kael’thas in this patch.  </p>
  
  <p>This doesn’t mean that no burst Assassins should have this type of mobility;
  it’s part of Li-Ming’s core gameplay design, for example. For the types of
  ranged Heroes for which Bolt is appropriate, we balance around their mobility.
  For Jaina and Kael’thas, however, we think removing Bolt and compensating them
  in other ways will result in healthier gameplay and Talent diversity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Kael’thas has had a lot of problems with his
  Talent pick rates. Chain Bomb has also evolved into a core part of the fantasy
  of playing the Hero, but was tied to a level 13 Talent. We decided to embrace
  this aspect of Kael’thas while introducing more counter-play to how he
  explodes Living Bomb so that it’s less frustrating to play against. Kael’thas
  should now be very effective at punishing enemy teams who clump together.  </p>
  
  <p>We also added many Talents to promote Flamestrike as his primary source of
  damage, as well as a few higher skill-cap Talents which allow players to
  better show off their mastery of the Hero.  </p>
  
  <p>All of this power comes at a price, however, and for Kael’thas it’s his
  survivability. He no longer has access to Bolt of the Storm, and Arcane
  Barrier’s Shield amount has been lowered and tied to a quest on Mana Addict.
  While Kael’thas can dish out a ton of damage in teamfights, he should be a
  much more viable target for enemy teams to focus down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> When we approached Tychus, we noticed that he had
  a lot of generic Talents that were underutilized and failed to push him into a
  unique role. He could essentially overlap with several other ranged assassins
  such as Valla, and so we wanted to differentiate him through new Talents and a
  redesigned Trait. We decided to make his Trait an active ability, since it
  allowed us to be more aggressive with tuning it as compared to a passive
  Trait. A core part of Tychus’ gameplay now centers around his effectiveness
  against targets that have a lot of Health.  </p>
  
  <p>As part of this update, we made an effort to pit Talents with similar uses
  against one another so that players aren’t focused on going down a single
  build path, such as picking every survivability option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> One of our major goals with these changes was to
  make our favorite one-man wrecking crew the premier zone-control Hero in the
  game, and we feel that his new Talents help push him in that direction.
  Gazlowe now has three playstyles that he can build around with his Talent
  tree: Rock-it! Turret, Deth Lazor, or Xplodium Charge.  </p>
  
  <p>The buff to base Turret range should help him a lot in this regard, as he is
  much more effective during the early stages of the game. He can now also be a
  big threat if he can set up at an objective before the enemy team arrives.  </p>
  
  <p>We also took this opportunity to remove a lot of generic Talents and replace
  them with much more interesting ones--like, ya know, the ability for Turrets
  to shoot friggin’ lasers!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We started these changes off by looking for a more
  exciting Heroic ability for Sylvanas. After many iterations, we think we
  finally found something that can compete with Wailing Arrow. We’re excited to
  bring Mind Control to the Nexus, which will allow Sylvanas to ruin an enemy’s
  positioning while possibly sacrificing her own to do so.  </p>
  
  <p>Given its gravity, this change quickly led us down the rabbit hole of trying
  to fix her Talent pick-rates, so we took the opportunity to look into those
  while applying some of our newer Talent tree design philosophies. After the
  dust had settled, we realized our changes were going to remove a bit of the
  damage offered by her popular build paths, so we decided to increase her Basic
  Attack and Withering Fire damage to help even things out.</p>
