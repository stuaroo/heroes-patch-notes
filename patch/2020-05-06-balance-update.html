<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep structure damage reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Structures will only focus their attacks on enemy Heroes if they attack an allied Hero who is also in their range.</li>
<li>Self-damage from Heroes will no longer cause structures to focus them.</li>
<li>Periodic damage over time will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to the Call for Help system
  that should help the overall player experience. We believe that currently
  Towers are punishing aggressive play too much, so we're lowering their damage
  to give diving Heroes more time to make plays before they have to escape. Our
  goal overall with the system is to still have aggressive play be possible and
  rewarded, but to also give the defending team a way to punish prolonged Tower
  dives, which is primarily due to the stacking Armor debuff. We're also
  changing the A.I. of structures to require that both the attacking and
  defending Hero be in their range in order for them to switch aggro onto an
  aggressor. This means that the defending Hero needs to also be near their
  structures in order to be defended, and it removes some unintuitive situations
  where a Hero can get aggro from attacks that are happening in far away places.
  Lastly, periodic damage will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes, so
  Heroes like Lunara will no longer pull aggro for the entirety of their DoT
  effects.</p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Objective Missile damage increased from 1800 to 1900. <a class="label label-warning" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/ggulkf/falsely_documented_changes_in_the_2501_patch/" target="_blank">Undocumented <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning">This change was implemented in game on 2020-05-12</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Samurai Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Laner version Health reduced from 8,000 to 7,200.
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning">This change was implemented in game on 2020-05-12</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Laner version Health scaling reduced by ~10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players believe the pushing
  Samurai camp is too strong and the objective is too weak. For some insight, we
  purposefully designed the map so that the Samurai camp was uniquely powerful,
  and we wanted it to be a viable, effective strategy that was available for a
  large portion of the game, particularly since the map only has 2 lanes. Now
  that the map has been out for some time, we believe that the balance of power
  can shift a little in favor of the objective being a more central way to win
  the game.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shield amount increased from 375 to 385.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seasoned Marksman [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reactive Parry [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Damaging enemies with the first slash of Twin Blades grants Artanis 75 Physical Armor against the next enemy Hero Basic Attack. If the target is an enemy Hero, then the second slash grants Artanis an additional stack. Stores up to 2 charges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New Talent: Protector of Aiur [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Quest: Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes increase Artanis's Attack Damage by .1%. Takedowns grant 1% bonus damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warp Sickness [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chrono Surge [E]</strong>
<ul>

<li>Additional functionality: Phase Prism Slows the enemy's Movement Speed by 30% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Artanis some small baseline buffs and
  changing some of his lesser-picked talents to have more practical use cases.
  We're also combining the effects of Warp Sickness and Chrono Surge into one
  talent, which should make that choice at Level 7 more powerful overall while
  also giving a clearer choice for Artanis players who want to build around
  hitting enemy Heroes with Phase Prism.</p>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cataclysm [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodic damage reduced from 10 to 9.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heat Wave [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage after using Incinerate reduced from 14 to 12 per second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firestorm [Z]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce Deathwing's landing cooldowns by 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces Deathwing's landing cooldowns when hitting enemy Heroes.</li>
<li>Healing increased from 2.5% to 3% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathwing continues to be a terror in the Nexus.
  While he's in a much better place now, he can use some more toning down. We're
  also addressing Skyfall's domination of his Level 7 talents but removing one
  of its effects and giving it to Firestorm. For players who want to build
  around going up and landing more often, Firestorm will now be the premier
  talent for that playstyle, whereas players who want to do damage while in the
  air, interrupt objectives, or heal themselves more can continue to take
  Skyfall.</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Paralyzing Enzymes [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 16.</li>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Drag duration by .5 seconds. After it ends, enemies hit are Slowed by 30% for 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>New talent: Pack Leader [Z]</strong>
<ul>
<li>While Dehaka is in a bush and for 5 seconds after leaving, he gains 20 Armor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been quite awhile since we last changed Dehaka,
  and the game has changed significantly since that time. We're giving him a
  small buff to Dark Swarm and combining Constriction and Paralyzing Enzymes to
  create a more powerful, single talent. We're also adding a strong defensive
  option at Level 16 that plays into his desire to fight near bushes.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the Movement Speed of enemy Heroes hit by Celestial Charge by 25% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To help it compete with other talents on its tier and
  to give it a little more identity, we're adding a Slow to Pathetic Mortals.
  This change will also help the talent's visual clarity since enemies will be
  Slowed while they have the damage reduction debuff.</p>

<li>Damage to enemies hit by its outer area increased from 198 to 250.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since Sulfuras Smash was the
  premier Heroic on Ragnaros, back when he and his best buddy Taunt Varian
  dominated the competitive scene. Things have changed, and over the years Lava
  Wave has risen to dominance, so we're giving Sulfuras Smash some love so that
  it can see a return to its glory days.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now that we have more data, we're making some more

<li><strong>New Talent: Overwhelming Power [Q]</strong>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sustaining Power has been a difficult sell as a
  competitive option for Alarak. Players who want to improve Lightning Surge are
  more inclined to go for Extended Lightning, since it adds more benefits that
  synergize with later talents. Instead of buffing Sustaining Power in hopes
  that it outshines Extended Lightning, we're changing it to do its own unique
  effect. Overwhelming Power should synergize well with talents like Hindered
  Motion and Mocking Strikes, allowing Alarak players who are able to stick to
  their targets to do a lot of sustained damage while keeping themselves alive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since her release, Cassia has been a great counter-
  pick against teams bringing multiple Basic Attackers. When she was being
  created, the Hero Designer was working closely with the Live Design team to
  find a good niche for her to fill. Since that time, however, our design
  philosophies have changed, and you have been seeing us pull-back from any
  individual Hero being too sharp in their designs. The War Matron is no
  exception and her rework tries to keep her original playstyle intact while
  also opening up options for players to bring her into more team compositions.
  Our other goals with the rework were to enhance her Lightning Javazon fantasy
  and introduce new talent-interactions for aficionados to really sink their
  teeth into. It would seem that with Cassia lightning does in fact strike twice
  and we are excited to see what you can do with her!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We always have to be careful about introducing too
  much power into Hero designs that are both mobile and bursty, because even if
  they are balanced on paper, they can feel extremely oppressive to play
  against. When this does happen, our normal reaction is to slowly tune those
  Heroes down until they don't feel awful to play against. Unfortunately, this
  can cause a variety of issues; in Tracer's case, she became extremely reliant
  on a handful of other Heroes to really open up her kit and make it work. With
  her rework, we focused on trying to make her feel a bit more self-reliant
  while also giving opponents a bit more time to react to her Recall and lock
  her down. On top of this, we have rebuilt her talent tree in order to give our
  Pulse-Pistol wielding Heroine some fun new options while she time-jumps around
  the Nexus.</p>
