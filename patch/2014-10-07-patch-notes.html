<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1485045593/officialpatchlogo.jpg"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/16081848" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/16081848" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 6.5</small></div>

<p>A little over a week ago, we brought Heroes of the Storm offline in order to prepare for the final phase of Technical Alpha testing. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that the <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/15951023">Calm Before the Storm</a> has passed, and we’ve got a brand new patch available for you. The Heroes Technical Alpha is now back online and you can check out our complete patch notes below.</p>

<p><em><strong>All Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha accounts have been reset with today’s patch.</strong></em></p>

<p>Today’s patch marks our final planned Heroes of the Storm account wipe and monetary refund.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>All purchases made using real-money prior to today’s account wipe have been reset and refunded to your Battle.net balance.</em>
<ul>
<li>From now on, any real-money and Gold purchases made in the Heroes Shop are permanent and will not need to be reacquired in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All in-game Gold earned, as well as any purchases made using Gold, have been wiped clean, along with all experience points, Hero and Player Level progression, Daily Quests, and rewards.</li>
<li>Future updates may still require adjustments or wipes for player progression, but there are no further plans to do so, and this will be avoided whenever possible.</li>
<li>Please see the Shop section below for more details on purchases using Battle.net Balance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Double XP Week</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For one week following today’s patch, games played in any matchmaking mode (Practice, Cooperative, and Versus) will award <strong><em>double</em></strong> the normal amount of experience points!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Diablo III: Reaper of Souls Pre-Order Bonus</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Valla, the Demon Hunter, is now unlocked and playable for all Technical Alpha testers who previously pre-ordered the Reaper of Souls expansion for Diablo III.</li>
<li><em>Please Note: This promotion did not grant Technical Alpha testing access. Players that pre-ordered Reaper of Souls, but have not yet been invited into the Tech Alpha, will receive Valla once they have Heroes of the Storm access in the future.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All Players Have Been Moved to Their Home Battle.net Region</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Heroes of the Storm now utilizes the friends list that is shared across all other Blizzard games.</li>
<li><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/forum/topic/14579397940">As mentioned previously</a>, <strong>all friend lists built in the previous Technical Alpha phase have been lost</strong>.</li>
<li>Friends in other Blizzard games can now communicate with Heroes players and see that they are playing Heroes of the Storm.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Support for Additional Regions Coming Soon</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We’re nearly ready to expand Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha testing in China, Korea, and Taiwan, and will soon bring servers online in those regions.</li>
<li>Once the patch becomes available in China, Korea, and Taiwan, invited players from those regions will be able to make real-money purchases using the Heroes in-game Shop.</li>
<li>Additionally, the Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha game client will soon feature full audio and text translations for the following languages:
<ul>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Simplified Chinese</li>
<li>Traditional Chinese</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
