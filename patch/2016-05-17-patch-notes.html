<p>We just released a new patch for Heroes of the Storm, which brings a new Hero,
User Interface improvements, balance changes, and much more to the game. Check
out the patch notes below.</p>

<h3 id="new-hero-chromie">New Hero: Chromie</h3>

<p><strong>Chromie, Keeper of Time,</strong> has been added to Heroes of the Storm and is now available for play! Read on for a brief overview of her Abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Trait</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timewalker</strong>
<ul>
<li>You’ve traveled into the future, and as such, will learn your Talents 1 level earlier than your teammates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sand Blast (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>After 1 second, fire a long-range blast that damages the first enemy Hero it hits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dragon’s Breath (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fire a blast into the air that lands after 1.5 seconds, dealing damage to enemies in an area. Enemies cannot see where the blast will land.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time Trap (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Place a Time Trap that arms and Stealths after 2 seconds. The first enemy Hero to touch it will be placed into Stasis for 2 seconds. Only 1 Trap can exist at once.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Slowing Sands (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create a swirling vortex of sand which greatly slows enemies caught within its area of effect. The longer Slowing Sands is active, the greater its slow becomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Temporal Loop (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Target enemy Hero will be teleported 3 seconds back in time to the position they were in when you initially cast Temporal Loop.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="system-changes">System Changes</h3>

<p><strong>Hero League Matchmaking</strong></p>

<p>The top few hundred players in the world have extremely high matchmaking
ratings (MMR), and the MMR gap between these players and the general
population can be dramatic. At times, only a few of these extremely talented
players are in the queue waiting for a match. In these cases, a highly-skilled
player could previously be matched with several of the best available allies
in queue, along with one lower-rated player in order to help balance out the
team’s average MMR and find a match more quickly.</p>

<p>A new change has been implemented with today’s patch in which the matchmaking
system will prefer to create a game that’s a little less even, using the
highest-rated players available, rather than create an even game that includes
lesser-skilled players.</p>

<p>In the overwhelming majority of the games it creates, the matchmaking system
prefers very even matches. However, in cases like those described above, the
matchmaking system will prefer to create games where the high-level player has
a slight advantage, but all players are closer in skill, rather than set up a
match where the high-level player has to work harder to “carry” a lesser-
skilled teammate. In essence, today’s change will help to maintain the overall
fairness and integrity of the league over the fairness of that specific match.
Additionally, this should only occur after a relatively lengthy wait in the
Hero League queue.</p>

</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Healing Well</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>25% of a Healing Well’s maximum Health has been converted into a Shield. Shield Regeneration delay of 8 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve noticed some rather un-fun behavior in the
  form of sniping Healing Wells over time using very long range Abilities. While
  we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective
  given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable
  portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer
  your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away
  every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield. Only
  <em>you</em> can protect Healing Wells from those pesky Arcane Orbs!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>

<p><strong>Battle Momentum</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Battle Momentum has been made Hero-specific, and now only applies to Basic Ability cooldowns.</li>
<li><strong>Diablo</strong>
<ul>
<li>Diabolical Momentum
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.</li>
<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Johanna</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blessed Momentum
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kerrigan</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bladed Momentum
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.</li>
<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tyrael</strong>
<ul>
<li>Angelic Momentum
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.</li>
<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tyrande</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lunar Momentum
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.6 seconds instead of 0.5.</li>
<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zagara</strong>
<ul>
<li>Swarm Momentum
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.</li>
<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability or Trait cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Our intention for Battle Momentum was to create
  more active gameplay by using your Basic Abilities more often, but we found
  that a lot of this Talent’s power lied in its ability to reduce your Heroic
  cooldowns. We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,
  but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By
  making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed
  us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve
  also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without
  affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature
  of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Conjurer's Pursuit</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.
<ul>
<li><strong>Quest:</strong> Gather Regeneration Globes to permanently increase Mana Regeneration by 0.10 per second, up to a maximum of 2.5 per second.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> After gathering 25 Regeneration Globes, also increases maximum Mana by 100.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve added a completion point to this Talent.
  Upon completing its quest, players will be provided with some additional
  power. This allows us to offer spikes of power in-between Talent levels, or
  even for a single player on a team. Now, simply picking the Talent and only
  partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger
  reward. Choosing the right Talents on the right Battleground or with the right
  team composition has always been an important goal for us, and this change
  pushes this Talent to closer align with that goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Executioner</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This Talent has been reworked.
<ul>
<li>Increases Basic Attack damage by 30% for 3 seconds after hitting a Stunned, Slowed, or Rooted target with a Basic Attack. Using Basic Attacks against a Slowed, Rooted, or Stunned target during this time will refresh the buff duration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We like the punishing nature of Executioner, but
  have found over time that its benefit to the player is too narrowly scoped.
  We’re changing the Talent to be more consistently useful by giving the player
  a temporary Attack Damage buff that procs when they first hit a crowd
  controlled target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hardened Focus</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Health bar next to the Hero Portrait will now display a marker that indicates whether the Hero is above or below 80% Health.</li>
<li>Will now display an icon in the Buff bar next to the Hero Portrait while its effects are active.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regeneration Master</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.
<ul>
<li><strong>Quest:</strong> Regeneration Globes now grant 1.0 Health per second, stacking up to 30</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Upon gathering 30 Globes, also increases Health by 500</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Please see the Developer Comment for Conjurer’s
  Pursuit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Seasoned Marksman</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.
<ul>
<li><strong>Quest:</strong> Increases Attack Damage by 0.2 for each enemy Minion killed nearby, and 0.5 for each Hero Takedown, up to a maximum of 40.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> After gaining 40 bonus Attack Damage, Seasoned Marksman can be activated to increase Attack Speed by 30% for 3 seconds. 60 second cooldown. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We have been trying our best to support and
  balance the ‘mage’ versus ‘auto-attack’ builds that Falstad has access to, but
  continue to teeter-totter as small changes to popular Talents tend to dictate
  full build-paths. The changes Falstad is receiving may seem massive (and to an
  extent they are), but we tried our best to keep his current builds intact
  while opening some new and exciting combinations. Overall, we are not hoping
  for a huge swing in power in one direction or the other, but to open up more
  compelling choices at each Talent tier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve received a lot of feedback from players
  regarding the popular strategy of chaining movement impairing effects, like
  Stuns and Roots, on an enemy Hero. While we want this to be a viable way to
  play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of
  play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in
  the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise
  want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.
  While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control
  of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones. As always, we
  will make further changes if necessary.</p>
