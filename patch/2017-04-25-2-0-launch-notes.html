<h3 id="new-hero-genji">New Hero: Genji</h3>

<p>Once the carefree youngest scion of the Shimada clan, Genji was cut down by
his own brother for refusing to take part in their illegal ventures. Grafted
into a cyborg body by Overwatch, Genji walks his own path as one who fights
for what’s right.</p>

<li><strong>Shuriken (Q)</strong>

</ul></li>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="new-battleground-hanamura">New Battleground: Hanamura</h3>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Protected Cores</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both Cores are protected by a barrier that cannot be attacked by Heroes.</li>
<li>Payloads must be escorted across the Battleground in order to deal damage to the enemy Core.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Escort Payloads</strong>
<ul>
<li>The first set of Payloads spawn for each team after 2:30 into the match, and additional waves will periodically spawn throughout the rest of the game.</li>
<li>Stand near an allied payload to escort it. The more allies who are present to escort a payload, the faster it will move. This effect caps at 3 nearby allies.</li>
<li>Payloads that haven’t been escorted for a period of time will begin to slowly move backward.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Empowered Payloads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Destroying enemy Forts will cause the next allied Payload to deal additional damage when it arrives at its destination.</li>
<li>Destroying enemy Keeps will cause Sappers to spawn with allied Minion waves, which will fire on the Core upon reaching the end of their lanes.</li>
<li>Deal a total of 7 damage the opposing Core to claim victory!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenary Camps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Three types of Mercenary Camps exist on Hanamura, and captured Mercenaries will not travel down a lane to attack enemies.
<ul>
<li>Instead, captured Mercenary Camps will each award one of three consumable power-ups.</li>
<li>Right-click a power-up to collect it, and then use the “Map Mechanic Ability” hotkey (Default: F) to activate it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recon Camp</strong>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="progression-system">Progression System</h3>

<p><strong>Player Progression Updates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Player level progression is no longer capped at 40.</li>
<li>Existing Hero levels have been converted to match new XP requirements without loss of Hero level.</li>
<li>Player level is now the sum of all Hero levels earned beyond 1.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If you have 5 heroes at level 5, your player level will be 20.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Player progression badges in the Profile, Score Screen, and Quest Log will display the player’s current level up to 99.
<ul>
<li>Player progression badge art will receive more decoration every 25 player levels.</li>
<li>Every 100 player levels, the level displayed in the progression badge will reset, and the badge will upgrade with even more ornate artwork.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Basic Portrait Border no longer displays the player’s current level.
<ul>
<li>Instead, the Basic Portrait Border will update every 100 levels with new art that matches the player’s progression badge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players can still view their total player level by checking their profiles, or by hovering the cursor over their portraits in the game’s menus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Progression Updates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Individual Hero levels are no longer capped at 20.</li>
<li>Every time players gain a Hero level their player level will increase accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Level XP Requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>XP requirements have been slightly increased during the first few Hero levels.
<ul>
<li>This should make early levels feel more meaningful by limiting cases where a Hero could gain multiple levels after a single game.</li>
<li>Low level Heroes will not lose any levels after transitioning to these new XP requirements.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A Hero who had progressed 50% into level 3 prior to release will not be adjusted down to level 2 in the new system. Instead, that Hero will remain at level 3 with 50% of the XP needed to get to level 4.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>XP requirements have been significantly reduced during later Hero levels.
<ul>
<li>This will decrease the amount of play time needed to progress through higher Hero levels by approximately 75 – 80% for the average player.</li>
<li>As a result, Heroes who were above level 5 in the previous system will gain one or more Hero levels.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Heroes who were level 10 should adjust to approximately Level 15 in the new progression system. A former level 20 Hero will convert to about level 54.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="progression-rewards-and-new-items">Progression Rewards and New Items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open Loot Chests, or purchase new ones, by heading to the new Loot screen added to the top navigation bar in the game’s menus.</li>

<li>Each Loot Chest will award 4 randomized items of varying rarity: Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary.
<ul>
<li>Click on an available Loot Chest to open it, revealing 4 Nexus Coins, which will shimmer and glow with a color that matches the rarity of their items.</li>
<li>Click each coin to unveil the treasures they hide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are currently 4 different types of Loot Chests: basic Loot Chests, Rare, Epic, and Hero-specific.
<ul>
<li>While all Loot Chests may drop items of any rarity, Rare and Epic Loot Chests are guaranteed to contain at least one item that matches that chest’s rarity level, or higher.</li>
<li>Hero-specific Loot Chests are guaranteed to contain at least one item associated with that Hero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Re-Roll Loot Chest Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>The items awarded by a Loot Chest can be re-rolled using Gold.
<ul>
<li>Each Loot Chest can be re-rolled up to 3 times.</li>
<li>The first re-roll costs 250 Gold, and the price increases by 250 per additional re-roll on the same Chest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upon confirming a re-roll, that Loot Chest’s original contents will be permanently discarded, and replaced by a new set of 4 randomized Nexus Coins. Re-roll carefully!</li>

<h3 id="collection">Collection</h3>

<p><strong>Introducing Your Collection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Heroes of the Storm in-game Shop has been transformed into your Collection, which is the central location where players can browse through the Heroes and cosmetic items they own, and unlock the ones they don’t.</li>
<li>Switch among item categories using the row of tabs found along the top of your Collection screen.
<ul>
<li>Hover the cursor over an item to use the purchasing options available for that item, or to Forge it using Shards. Click Heroes, Skins, Mounts, and Banners to view them in more detail.</li>
<li>Use the dropdown menus found on each category page to filter items by owned, unowned, release date, and more. Enter keywords in the Search bar to find specific items.</li>
<li>The Bundles tab has been removed, and all available Bundles will now appear on your Collection’s Featured tab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>​Upon receiving previously unowned items in a Loot Chest, the total number of new items added to your Collection will be displayed on the Collection button in the top navigation bar.
<ul>
<li>Additional new item notifications will appear on each category tab in your Collection where a new item can be found, as well as on the sub-category buttons found on the left side of each category page.</li>
<li>Clear new item notifications by right-clicking the associated category and sub-category buttons in your Collection, and then selecting “Mark items as seen.”</li>
<li>Alternatively, navigate to each new item manually and hover the cursor over them to clear the notification for that item.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Currency: Gems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Gems have replaced real money as the primary currency in Heroes of the Storm.
<ul>
<li>Gems can be used to purchase Heroes, Bundles, Loot Chests, Stimpacks, and Featured Items.</li>
<li>Additional Gems can be purchased using real money in the Gem Shop.
<ul>
<li>Enter the Gem Shop by clicking the “+” button found next to the Gem counter added to the top navigation bar in the game’s menus.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Existing Currency: Gold</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Gold can be used to purchase Heroes and Loot Chest re-rolls.</li>
<li>Gold will still be awarded through Hero progression, as well as upon completing matches, Daily Quests, and Heroes Brawls.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Crafting Material: Shards</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As mentioned previously, Shards are a new crafting material that can be collected and used to Forge cosmetic items, including: Skins, Mounts, Announcers, Banners, Emoji packs, Sprays, Portraits, and Voice Lines.
<ul>
<li>Varying amounts of Shards can appear as Loot Chest drops.</li>
<li>Any duplicate items received in a Loot Chest will automatically fragment into Shards.​</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Items</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The items listed below have been added to the Collection, and will be available for Gem purchase for a limited time.</li>
<li><strong>New Skins</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genji</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oni Genji, Vengeful Oni Genji, Moss Oni Genji</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Auriel</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sakura Auriel, Spring Sakura Auriel, Scarlet Sakura Auriel</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zarya</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cyberdemon Zarya, Indigo Cyberdemon Zarya, Cyborgdemon Zarya</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>New Bundles and Skin Packs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Genji Heroic Bundle</li>
<li>Sakura Auriel Skin Pack</li>
<li>Cyberdemon Zarya Skin Pack
​
<strong>Skin and Mount Changes</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Skin Variations, Mount Variations, and Master Skins have been reclassified as individual items.</p>

<ul>
<li>Players can receive these items as Loot Chest drops, or Forge them using Shards, but they are no longer unlocked via Hero progression.</li>
<li>Players who owned any Skins, Master Skins, and Mounts prior to Heroes of the Storm 2.0 will still be able to use them after release.
<ul>
<li>In addition to the base version of those Skins and Mounts, players will also permanently receive both of those items’ variations —whether or not they had previously unlocked them through progression.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Featured and New Items</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to Forging Skins and Mounts using Shards, or finding them in Loot Chests, a number of Featured Skins and Mounts will be available for Gem purchase in the Collection.
<ul>
<li>To keep things fresh, the list of Featured Skins and Mounts will rotate on a regular basis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many newly released Skins and Mounts will also be purchasable using Gems for several weeks following their arrival to the Nexus.</li>
<li>Much like new Heroes receive a Gold price reduction once they’ve been in the Nexus for a few weeks, new Skins and Mounts that are unlockable using Gems start at a higher than normal Shard price. These items will receive a Shard price reduction a few weeks after they are added to the game.
<ul>
<li>New items that are only unlockable via Loot Chests and Forging (such as a new version of an existing Skin) will not start at a higher Shard price, or receive a Shard price reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>​<strong>Seasonal Items</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some existing holiday-themed Skins and Mounts, including Winter Veil, Hallow’s End, Lunar Festival, and other seasonal items, will only be unlockable during in-game events for those holidays.
<ul>
<li>Unlock seasonal and holiday-themed items during their associated in-game events via Loot Chest drops, or by forging them with Shards. </li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In an effort to reduce the frustration of playing
  against Valeera, we're reducing her burst damage potential. Especially in
  Quick Match when counter picking isn't an option, the ability for a stealth
  assassin with disabling effects and high burst damage isn't fun or healthy for
  the game, so we're toning it down some.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> With Uther’s rework, we want to play up his ability
  to be a disruptive frontline presence, keep his role as an anti-burst Healer,
  but maintain the weakness of not having great sustained healing. By making
  Holy Light always heal Uther, he doesn’t mind as much when he takes damage
  from being up there. Having his abilities apply Armor is a great way to make
  him an effective support against teams with predictable damage, while having
  lower healing per second compared to the other supports. Ideally, you’ll pick
  Uther when your team could use a stronger frontline, when your opponents are
  very reliant on disabling effects, or when the enemy team has predictable
  incoming damage.</p>
