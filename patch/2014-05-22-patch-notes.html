<p>We've brought the Heroes of the Storm service down for a period of extended
maintenance today in order to release a brand new patch for the Technical
Alpha. Maintenance is ongoing, but don't worry; we'll let you know as soon as
the Nexus is back online! In the meantime, you can check out complete patch
notes below.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>

<p><strong>All returning Heroes of the Storm players will be <em>required to re-install the game</em> in order to receive today's patch. Please see the notes below for install instructions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Returning players</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once today’s maintenance concludes, completely exit and restart your Battle.net desktop app.</li>
<li>Upon restarting, your existing Heroes of the Storm icon in the Battle.net app’s Games list will read “Uninstall Me.” Click this icon, and then hit the big blue “Uninstall” button to uninstall Heroes.</li>
<li>A new Heroes of the Storm icon will appear in the Battle.net app Games list. Select this icon, and then click “Install” to receive the new client and today’s patch.</li>
<li>Hit “Play” to launch Heroes once installation completes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New players</strong>:</p>

<p>If you’ve <strong>never</strong> installed Heroes before, but have received a Tech Alpha
invitation, all you’ll need to do is select the Heroes of the Storm icon in
the Battle.net app’s Games list, click “Install”, and then hit “Play” to get
started!</p>

<p>Finally, installation will be disabled in the Battle.net app during
maintenance. You will be able to install the client once the Heroes service is
back online.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>Terrain Textures on Low graphic settings have received several improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>Rejoin Game</strong></p>

<p>A very early version of rejoin functionality has been implemented. Please know
that development for the Rejoin system is ongoing, and this feature will
likely see changes and improvements as alpha testing continues.</p>

<ul>
<li>Players are now able to rejoin a game after disconnecting or closing the client.</li>
<li>Players who disconnect or otherwise leave a game will be prompted to rejoin upon logging back in so long as that game is still in progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, this is a very early look at the Rejoin system, and you
may encounter bugs during playtesting. If you do encounter any issues with the
Rejoin system, please let us know by writing up a bug report in the <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/forum/13268292/">Tech
Alpha Bug Report Forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Inactive Player Removal</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Very early implementation for removing inactive players from a game has been added with today’s Tech Alpha patch. Please note that much like Rejoin above, this system is a work in progress, and will likely receive changes in the future. Here’s how it works right now:
<ul>
<li>If a player does not issue a game command for 150 seconds during a match, that player will receive an inactivity warning via chat.</li>
<li>If a player does not issue a game command within 30 seconds after receiving a warning, that player will be dropped from the game and returned to the Heroes login screen.</li>
<li>Inactive players who are dropped in this way will be prompted to rejoin from the out-of-game menus after logging back in.</li>
<li>As with leaving or disconnecting from a game before it is finished, the A.I. will take over the dropped player’s hero until that player rejoins the game. Additionally, that player will earn no experience points, quest credit, or rewards if they do not rejoin the game before it concludes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Matchmaking</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rules have been added to help encourage the matchmaker to create well-rounded team compositions. These rules are as follows:
<ul>
<li>No more than 3 Warriors.</li>
<li>No more than 4 Assassins.</li>
<li>No more than 2 Support.</li>
<li>No more than 2 Specialists.</li>
<li>No more than 3 Melee heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please note that this does not prevent full parties from using any composition they prefer.</li>
<li>Team compositions which fall outside of the rules above can still be formed with partial parties.
<ul>
<li><em>For example</em>: A three person party that enters the queue as 3 Support heroes is allowed, but will not be grouped with any more Supports.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a party has spent longer than 6 minutes in the matchmaking queue, the team composition rules may be broken in order to find a match.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quick Cast</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A Quick Cast option has been added and can be accessed in the Gameplay Options menu.</li>
<li>Select one of three Quick Cast settings from the dropdown list. Each setting works as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Off</strong> <em>(default)</em>: Press an ability hotkey to enter targeting mode and then left click to cast the ability.</li>
<li><strong>On</strong>: Press an ability hotkey to instantly cast that ability in the direction, or at the location, of the mouse cursor.</li>
<li><strong>On Release</strong>: Press an ability hotkey to enter targeting mode. Release the hotkey to cast that ability in the direction, or at the location, of the mouse cursor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
