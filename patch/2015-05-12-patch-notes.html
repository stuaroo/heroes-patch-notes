<p>We’ve brought Heroes of the Storm offline for a period of extended maintenance
today in order to bring you a brand new Closed Beta patch! Maintenance is
ongoing, but don't worry; we'll let you know just as soon as the Nexus is back
online. In the meantime, you can check out the complete patch notes below.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Please visit the <em><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19085485">official Heroes of the Storm site</a></em> to learn more about these icons, and how to troubleshoot the performance issues they indicate.</em></li>
