<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1490811754/patchlogo2017-03-29.jpg"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20638783" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20638783" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 2.25.0</small></div>

up a few times! Head to the <a href="https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/index">official Heroes

<h3 id="new-hero-cassia">New Hero: Cassia</h3>

<p>After shattering the Worldstone, the young Amazon Cassia had changed. She had
seen hatred, terror, and destruction firsthand. If the Askari were to survive
the coming darkness, they needed an army. She would begin their training
immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Trait</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoidance</strong>
<ul>
<li>When moving unmounted, Cassia gains 65 Physical Armor against Heroic Basic Attacks, reducing the damage taken by 65%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lightning Fury (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hurl a javelin that damages the first enemy hit, and splits into two lightning bolts that deal damage to enemies in their paths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blinding Light (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>After 0.5 seconds, Blind enemies in the target area for 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Passive: Cassia deals 15% increased damage to Blinded targets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fend (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Charge at an enemy and on arrival channel for 1.5 seconds, damaging enemies in front of Cassia every 0.25 seconds.</li>
<li>Deals 50% reduced damage to non-Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ball Lightning (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Throw a ball of lightning at an enemy Hero that bounces up to 6 times between nearby enemy Heroes and Cassia, damaging enemies hit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Valkyrie (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Summon a Valkyrie that rushes to Cassia after 0.75 seconds, pulling and damaging the first enemy Hero hit and stunning them for 0.5 seconds at the end of her rush.</li>
<li>The Valkyrie knocks back all other enemy Heroes in her way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="progression-system">Progression System</h3>

<p><strong>Player Progression Updates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Player level progression is no longer capped at 40.</li>
<li>Existing Hero levels have been converted to match new XP requirements without loss of Hero level.</li>
<li>Player level is now the sum of all Hero levels earned beyond 1.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If you have 5 heroes at level 5, your player level will be 20.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Player progression badges in the Profile, Score Screen, and Quest Log will display the player’s current level up to 99.
<ul>
<li>Player progression badge art will receive more decoration every 25 player levels.</li>
<li>Every 100 player levels, the level displayed in the progression badge will reset, and the badge will upgrade with even more ornate artwork.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Basic Portrait Border no longer displays the player’s current level.
<ul>
<li>Instead, the Basic Portrait Border will update every 100 levels with new art that matches the player’s progression badge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players can still view their total player level by checking their profiles, or by hovering the cursor over their portraits in the game’s menus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Progression Updates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Individual Hero levels are no longer capped at 20.</li>
<li>Every time players gain a Hero level their player level will increase accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Level XP Requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>XP requirements have been slightly increased during the first few Hero levels.
<ul>
<li>This should make early levels feel more meaningful by limiting cases where a Hero could gain multiple levels after a single game.</li>
<li>Low level Heroes will not lose any levels after transitioning to these new XP requirements.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A Hero who had progressed 50% into level 3 prior to release will not be adjusted down to level 2 in the new system. Instead, that Hero will remain at level 3 with 50% of the XP needed to get to level 4.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>XP requirements have been significantly reduced during later Hero levels.
<ul>
<li>This will decrease the amount of play time needed to progress through higher Hero levels by approximately 75 – 80% for the average player.</li>
<li>As a result, Heroes who were above level 5 in the previous system will gain one or more Hero levels.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Heroes who were level 10 should adjust to approximately Level 15 in the new progression system. A former level 20 Hero will convert to about level 55.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="progression-rewards-and-new-items">Progression Rewards and New Items</h3>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Loot Chests are a new way to unlock cosmetic items and other rewards in Heroes of the Storm, and players will now receive a Loot Chest every time they level-up!
<ul>
<li>Open Loot Chests, or purchase new ones, by heading to the new Loot screen added to the top navigation bar in the game’s menus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each Loot Chest will award 4 randomized items of varying rarity: Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary.
<ul>
<li>Click on an available Loot Chest to open it, revealing 4 Nexus Coins, which will shimmer and glow with a color that matches the rarity of their items.</li>
<li>Click each coin to unveil the treasures they hide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are currently 4 different types of Loot Chests: basic Loot Chests, Rare, Epic, and Hero-specific.
<ul>
<li>While all Loot Chests may drop items of any rarity, Rare and Epic Loot Chests are guaranteed to contain at least one item that matches that chest’s rarity level, or higher.</li>
<li>Hero-specific Loot Chests are guaranteed to contain at least one item associated with that Hero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Re-Roll Loot Chest Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>The items awarded by a Loot Chest can be re-rolled using Gold.
<ul>
<li>Each Loot Chest can be re-rolled up to 3 times.</li>
<li>The first re-roll costs 250 Gold, and the price increases by 250 per additional re-roll on the same Chest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upon confirming a re-roll, that Loot Chest’s original contents will be permanently discarded, and replaced by a new set of 4 randomized Nexus Coins. Re-roll carefully!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chest Rewards and New Items</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Loot Chest rewards may include Heroes, Mounts, Skins, Stimpacks, and many new items being introduced with Heroes of the Storm 2.0:</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emoji Packs</strong>

<li>Each Emoji Pack contains 5 Emojis.</li>
<li>View all available Emojis by clicking the new Emoji button added to the out-of-game Chat bar.
<ul>
<li>Up to 10 Emojis can be set as Favorites. Right-click Emojis to add or remove them from Favorites.</li>
<li>Use Favorites during a match by clicking the heart button added to the right side of the in-game Chat bar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players’ Emojis will automatically convert to match the Heroes they are currently using, so long as they own that Hero’s Emoji Packs.
<ul>
<li>This will occur in-game, as well as after choosing a Hero during Hero Select or in Draft Lobbies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Portraits</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many new Portraits, featuring unique artwork and a variety of art styles, have been added to the game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shards are a new crafting material that can be used to Forge unowned cosmetic items.
<ul>
<li>​All cosmetic items that can be found in Loot Chests can be Forged, and all Forgeable items can be found in your Collection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Varying amounts of Shards can appear as Loot Chest drops.</li>
<li>Any duplicate items received in a Loot Chest will automatically fragment into Shards.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Revamped Progression Rewards</strong></p>

<ul>

</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Players can receive these items as Loot Chest drops, or Forge them using Shards, but they are no longer unlocked via Hero progression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em><strong>Please Note:</strong> Players who owned any Skins, Master Skins, and Mounts prior to Heroes of the Storm 2.0 will still be able to use them after release.</em>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the base version of those Skins and Mounts, players will also permanently receive both of those items’ variations —whether or not they had previously unlocked them through progression.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes to E.T.C. are a continuation of our
  attempt to align Warriors with a “big picture” role, so that we can continue
  to see a variety of them regardless of who’s really strong at the moment.
  Alongside a lot of specialization, we need a couple generalist Warriors, and
  we think E.T.C. (as well as Muradin) should fill that role. They should always
  be a safe pick for your team because they fit into every team composition or
  battleground, but may be outperformed by the specialized Warriors in their
  ideal situations. We found that having Attack Speed on his Trait pointed him
  toward Basic Attack teams and maps like Battlefield of Eternity, where
  sustained damage was important. Instead, we’ve decided to add general Armor,
  but wanted to make sure that it still had that fun “bard” style gameplay where
  playing optimally includes spreading out abilities. We’ve updated Show Stopper
  to provide less Armor, because stacking Armor makes every point more and more
  valuable. Lastly, we’ve reduced Echo Pedal’s damage against non-Minions and
  Mercenaries so that it’s the obvious pick when you need wave clear, but
  Hammer-On and Pinball Wizard are better during a team fight.</p>
