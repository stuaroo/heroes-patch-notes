<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1485045593/officialpatchlogo.jpg"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19803324" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19803324" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 11.1a, 12.1</small></div>

<p><strong><em>Update – July 21, 2015:</em> We’ve just released an update for Heroes of the Storm, which brings a new Hero, Skin, and Bundle to the Nexus. Check out the New Heroes and Shop sections below to learn more about today’s update.</strong></p>

<p>The struggle between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells has erupted out of
the realm of Sanctuary, and the Eternal Conflict has begun in the Nexus!
Angels and Demons now battle for dominance in their quests to destroy one
another, and we’ve brought Heroes of the Storm offline for a period of
extended maintenance in order to clean up after the mayhem they’ve wrought.
We’ll let you know just as soon as the Nexus is back online, but in the
meantime, you can check out today’s complete patch notes below.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Kill the Treasure Goblins!</strong></p>

<p>It seems that mischievous Treasure Goblins have snuck into the Nexus alongside
the arrival of the Burning Hells. These devious creatures are intent on
pilfering as much gold as they can carry, and while their numbers are yet
unknown, the fortunes they've scavenged must be returned! Adventurers that
manage to slay any Treasure Goblins they encounter during the Eternal Conflict
will be handsomely rewarded. A Treasure Goblin will do anything in its power
to evade those it deems hostile, so dispose of these timid beings swiftly,
lest they open a portal and slip away!</p>

<ul>
<li>Players will receive a Special Event Quest titled: “Kill a Treasure Goblin!” each day during the Eternal Conflict event.
<ul>
<li>Before the start of a match, any players with an active Special Event Quest will cause a Treasure Goblin to spawn at a random location near their team’s Core.</li>
<li>Kill the Treasure Goblin before the pregame timer reaches 0, or it will open a portal and escape the Battleground.</li>
<li>Any players with an active Special Event Quest that manage to kill a Treasure Goblin before it escapes will receive <strong>100 Gold</strong> for their efforts at the end of the match.</li>
<li>Treasure Goblins may spawn on any Battleground, in any matchmaking game mode (Versus A.I., Quick Match, Hero League, Team League).</li>
<li>This Special Event Quest is available to all players, whether or not they’ve unlocked Daily Quests by reaching Player Level 6.</li>
<li>While players are invited to kill as many Treasure Goblins as they can, this Special Event Quest can only be completed once per day. Incomplete Quests do not stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Portrait Rewards</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Portrait</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Heroes of the Storm Facebook Page has reached 1 Million Likes! To help celebrate this social media milestone, all players who log in to the game before our next major patch arrives will receive a new, Facebook-themed portrait. Thank you for your support!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Golden Tiger Portrait</strong>
<ul>
<li>Any players that redeem the Golden Tiger Mount key found in the Heroes of the Storm Starter Pack will receive an exclusive new Golden Tiger portrait.
<ul>
<li>This portrait will also be retroactively granted to players who redeemed their Golden Tiger Mount key prior to today’s patch.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="new-battleground">New Battleground</h3>

<p>The conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells has spilled into
the Nexus, breeding a new Battleground that is equal parts righteous and
wicked. Angels, Demons, and now Heroes clash in ceaseless combat in their
struggle for dominance over the <strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Battlefield of Eternity is a two-lane Battleground featuring two massive Immortals that battle endlessly at its center, and teams must compete to defeat the opposing Immortal.</li>
<li>Once its foe has been toppled, the victorious Immortal will be restored to full Health, and proceed to seek out enemy Structures, attacking down the lane with the most remaining defenses.</li>
<li>An attacking Immortal will also gain a Shield, proportionate to the amount of Health it had remaining at the end of the battle.
<ul>
<li>The Immortal will perform ranged attacks, which each consume a portion of its Shield. Taking damage will also drain the Immortal’s Shield.</li>
<li>Once its Shield has been expended, the Immortal will only attack at melee range.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fallen Shaman</strong>
<ul>
<li>These malformed demons never stray too far from a pack of Fallen Hounds, and will quickly resurrect any Hounds that are killed in combat. Those who value their souls would be wise to first destroy the Shaman before targeting its Hound companions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Khazra</strong>
<ul>
<li>The half human, half goat creatures that inhabit Battlefield of Eternity are tough, ranged attackers that won’t hesitate to rain spears on their foes. Defeat the Khazra at their camps to harness their destructive appetite before the enemy team.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Battleground, More Often</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Starting today, the pool of Battlegrounds available in all modes, except Custom Games, will be temporarily limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>Battlefield of Eternity</li>
<li>Sky Temple</li>
<li>Tomb of the Spider Queen</li>
<li>Cursed Hollow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This has been done to increase the frequency with which players encounter the new Battleground, Battlefield of Eternity.</li>
<li>During this time, players can still select and play on any Battleground they wish using Custom Games.</li>
<li>All Battlegrounds, including Battlefield of Eternity, will once again be made available for play in all matchmaking game modes on Tuesday, July 7.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="design-amp-gameplay">Design &amp; Gameplay</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The difficulty ratings for many Heroes have been updated to better reflect their ease of play.</li>
<li>The rings found under Heroes in-game have been scaled to more closely match their hitboxes.</li>
<li>Skillshots and Abilities that use an arc pattern will now display their range when hovering the cursor over the associated button on the Ability hotbar.</li>
<li>Several Abilities were unintentionally providing brief moments of Unstoppable behavior during use. The following Abilities no longer provide Unstoppable:
<ul>
<li>Chen -- Flying Kick (Q)</li>
<li>Falstad -- Barrel Roll (E)</li>
<li>Illidan -- Dive (Q)</li>
<li>Illidan -- Sweeping Strikes (with the Unbound talent) (W)</li>
<li>Kerrigan -- Ravage (Q)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A number of Hero Abilities were not intended to completely Stun enemy targets. In these cases, Stuns have been converted to Dazes, which act similarly, but will no longer interrupt Abilities that can be channeled while the Hero is moving.
<ul>
<li>For example: Dazing Valla will not stop her from channeling Strafe.</li>
<li>The following abilities will now Daze, rather than Stun, enemy Heroes:
<ul>
<li>Brightwing -- Emerald Wind (R)</li>
<li>Chen -- Wandering Keg (R)</li>
<li>E.T.C. -- Face Melt (W)</li>
<li>Falstad -- Mighty Gust (R)</li>
<li>Kerrigan -- Primal Grasp (E)</li>
<li>Raynor -- Penetrating Round (Q)</li>
<li>Sgt. Hammer -- Concussive Blast (W)</li>
<li>Tychus -- Frag Grenade (W)</li>
