<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="design-amp-gameplay">Design &amp; Gameplay</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Abilities or Talents that apply Invulnerability or Stasis will now also display a timer to indicate the duration of these effects.</li>
<li>Damage dealt by splash and cleave attacks will no longer trigger effects that would otherwise require a direct attack to trigger (ex: Block, Spell Shield, Imposing Presence, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Battleground Monsters</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Battleground-specific creatures are now universally defined as <strong>Monsters</strong> (ex: Neutral Garden Terrors, Sky Temple Guardians, etc.)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Several Talents that could previously trigger against both captured Mercenaries and Minions will now only affect Minions (ex: Seasoned Marksman, Black Soulstone, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Towers, Forts, and Keeps now deal 50% bonus damage to Heroes</li>
<li>Cores will now display an “Invulnerable” message if attacked by an enemy when no allied Keeps have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Structures can no longer be made Vulnerable</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The scaling changes we released in December made
  it so Heroes could dive into Structures with impunity during the early game.
  Increasing the damage that Structures deal to Heroes allows defending players
  to feel a bit safer. We are exploring other fixes to help Structures feel more
  meaningful throughout the game and will release them when they are ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dragon Shire</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon Knight</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduction from Structures increased from 50% to 60%</li>
<li><strong>Savage Charge (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Channel time reduced from 1.125 to 0.75 seconds</li>
<li>Cooldown increased from 8 to 10 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Since the Dragon Knight is flagged as a Hero, the
  increased structure damage was doing too much damage; Increasing Rubble
  Maker’s effectiveness to compensate felt appropriate.</p>
  
  <p>Savage Charge felt like a dead button a lot of the time due to the Ability’s
  long channel time. This change has made the button feel a lot better to press.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The minimap now more clearly indicates when a Shrine is ready to activate</li>
<li><strong>Arcane Punisher</strong>
<ul>
<li>Arcane Sentry damage reduced by 20%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The Arcane Punishers have shown to be more
  effective than their Frozen and Mortar counterparts, so we lowered their
  Arcane Sentry damage to bring them more in line with other Punisher types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Towers of Doom</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ownership of nearby Bell Towers will no longer determine which lane Sapper Mercenaries will travel down. The two southern Sapper camps will now always travel down the bottom lane.</li>
<li>Text has been added to the Tunnels to help clarify their one-way use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Try Mode</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A new Healing Dummy has been added above the existing Target Dummy, that calculates healing and healing over time.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>

<p><strong>Block</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Block charges are now tracked in the buff bar next to the Hero portrait, and a timer has been added to show the time remaining until a new charge is generated.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focused Attack</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage bonus reduced from 75% to 60%</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The talent is doing a bit too much damage over the
  course of the game. We like that it is a highly contested pick on Basic Attack
  Heroes, but want to bring its overall power down a bit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Nova is a crowd favorite, and always at the top of
  our most played list. When we sat down to talk about what we wanted to do for
  her, we quickly realized that a slight Talent shuffle was not going to be
  possible. We wanted to keep her playstyle as similar to live as possible while
  also addressing some of our core concerns with her, which were:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>She can be very frustrating to play against for newer players.</li>
  <li>She isn’t viable in competitive play.</li>
  <li>Her Talent pick rates were not great.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This new direction for Nova addresses the first two issues by lowering her
  overall burst potential, while increasing her damage output overall. The most
  noticeable way we did this was through lowering both her Snipe cooldown and
  damage. For the third concern, we decided to do an overarching sweep of her
  Talents, removing the ones that weren’t working, and created some new ones
  that should offer interesting choices that promote Nova’s roaming and ganking
  nature. We realize that this is a slight departure from her long history of
  burst damage, but feel it is a better direction for her in the long run. We
  are watching her very carefully in order to react quickly and tune
  accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The Talent system is incredibly complex, and we
  continue to learn more about its nuances every day. As our philosophies grow
  and change, we attempt to utilize them in our Hero updates. Rehgar’s changes
  were driven by this, and will help us learn even more in the future. Here’s a
  very brief explanation:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Rehgar was usually brought to teams as a main support, which meant
  players were heavily incentivized to pick every healing option available to
  him. We tried to rectify this by placing healing Talents against each other on
  the same Talent tier. Of course, this removes some of his healing power as
  players cannot stack each Talent, so we also increased his base power to
  compensate. Our hope is that these changes will allow Rehgar players to be a
  more aggressive while supporting their team, which was always his design
  intent.</li>
