<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to the week of March 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be New Toy Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from New Toy Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gaining Unstoppable now prevents and removes Blinds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've read recent feedback that it is strange that
  Silences are removed by the Unstoppable behavior, but Blinds are not. While
  Unstoppable has traditionally been primarily intended to remove effects that
  cause a hero to not be able to control the movement of their character, this
  philosophy gets a little grey when it comes to Silences, as heroes can still
  freely move, but they lose their ability to use movement abilities. In the
  past we decided that it was better for Silences to be removed, but understand
  the argument that Blinds are effectively Silences for auto-attack based
  heroes. We're trying this change to see how it pans out, as Blinds have
  traditionally been very powerful forms of soft CC in our game and this can
  help out heroes that are heavily shut down by them.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experience Globes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes who kill Minions with Abilities or Basic Attacks will automatically collect the experience from the Minions.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will no longer time out while travelling to a hero.</li>
<li>They will still expire if the hero moves out of range of the Experience Globe before it reaches them.</li>
<li>Removed a .5 second delay before Experience Globes can be collected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we're excited for the experience globes and the
  increased clarity that they offer in regards to how experience is gained,
  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

<h3 id="tank">Tank</h3>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locust Swarm [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 62 to 68.</li>
<li>Healing increased from 21 to 24.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debilitation [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spellpower reduction duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beetle, Juiced [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Health of Beetles by 20%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These buffs are to some of Anub'arak's talents that
  have been lagging behind their competitors for some time. Beetle, Juiced in
  particular should now be more consistent in its benefit to round out a Beetle-
  oriented build, even if Anub'arak isn't able to get a lot of Basic Attacks off
  on enemy Heroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surging Fist [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Channel time to charge maximum distance reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Ogre Hide is active, Cho gains 15% Movement Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Gall's Ogre Rage is active, enemy Heroes who are hit by Gall's Dread Orb have their Healing reduced by 35% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Veil [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor bonus increased from 100% to 200%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since our Old God worshipping Ogre
  has had some love, so we're both buffing up some of Cho's weaker talents as
  well as reducing the time that Surging Fist needs to be channeled in order to
  get a significant charge. This should help make Cho's Q build more viable as
  well as allow him to better reposition himself during teamfights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="johanna">Johanna</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2700 to 2625.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 5.625 to 5.469.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Condemn [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 58 to 55.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Johanna's become a dominant force in the tanking
  world, and is currently the #1 most picked hero at high level play. Because of
  this, we're slightly reducing her Health, as well as reverting her previous
  Condemn buff.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bruiser">Bruiser</h3>

<h4 id="deathwing">Deathwing</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 3200 to 2920.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 6.67 to 6.08.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Incinerate [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 85 to 80.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Onslaught [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 42 to 40.</li>
<li>Damage at the end of the lunge reduced from 80 to 75.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cataslysm [R]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodic damage reduced from 12 to 11.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draconic Might [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduced from 40% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduced from 5% to 3% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burn Beneath My Shadow [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage reduced from 150% to 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementium Plating [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield amount reduced from 35% to 30% missing Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It turns out that Deathwing has lived up to his name,
  and has been destroying the Nexus since his release. Cataclysm and Burn
  Beneath My Shadow in particular have proven to be incredibly powerful, so
  we're reducing their effectiveness by a fairly significant amount. In addition
  to these changes, we're reducing the power of some overperforming talents as
  well as slightly nerfing his Destroyer form. Even with these changes, we
  expect Deathwing to continue to be a powerful addition to any team that he's
  on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="thrall">Thrall</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling Thunder [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: [Passive] Increase the number of Chain Lightning bounces by 1. For 8 seconds after hitting an enemy with Chain Lightning, Thrall's next Basic Attack against them grants him a stack of Frostwolf Resilience. If the target is an enemy Hero, then he also deals damage to them equal to 2% of their maximum Health and healing for the same amount.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Echo of the Elements and Crash Lightning are both
  fairly solid talents that have different use cases for when to pick them.
  Rolling Thunder has been less successful, so we're trying something new with
  the talent. We're still keeping its theme of marking targets with Chain
  Lightning and then hitting them for a bonus, but now this bonus will allow
  Thrall to deal bonus damage to enemy Heroes while also interacting with
  Frostwolf Resilience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="varian">Varian</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frenzy [R3]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer increases Varian's Attack Speed by 15%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Heroic Strike by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't super happy with the power of Frenzy's
  buff, as well as that it asked Varian players to learn a new Basic Attack
  cadence after being used to one speed the whole game. Instead, we're turning
  the Attack Speed bonus into a bonus to his damage over time by buffing Heroic
  Strike instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="yrel">Yrel</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dauntless [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical Armor duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Avenger [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Avenging Wrath at maximum charge also increases its damage by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templar's Verdict [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 6% to 7% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Favor [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holy Wrath [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus splash damage increased from 20% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word of Glory [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the amount that Yrel heals from damage received from 50% to 75%.</li>
<li>Range of allied healing increased from 8 to 12.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are mostly looking to buff Yrel's late-
  game by adding more power to her Level 16 talents. We want her to be more
  relevant without dominating the solo lane too much, so we're opting to make
  her Level 16 tier to be an exciting spike for her to hit in her games.</p>

<h4 id="auriel">Auriel</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resurrect [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Resurrected Hero's Health increased from 50% to 100%.</li>
<li>Delay before resurrection reduced from 5 to 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Auriel can now see her own ghost. If she presses R while dead, she will cast Resurrect on herself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying some fairly significant buffs to
  Resurrect in order to help it better compete with Crystal Aegis. Auriel can
  now Resurrect herself, which should help if she is the focus of the enemy
  team, and her targets will now come back faster and with all of their Health.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="brightwing">Brightwing</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greater Polymorph [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Polymorph's range by 30%. If Brightwing hits an enemy Hero with Arcane Flare's center within 2 seconds of being Polymorphed, then reduce Polymorph's cooldown by 7 seconds and gain 50 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last changes to Brightwing have better rounded
  out her talents, however Greater Polymorph was a little too hard to
  consistently proc. Instead of requiring her to hit a Polymorphed target, she
  now has a slightly larger window of time to get the cooldown reduction proc.
  We're also increasing the cooldown reduction bonus from 6 to 7 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Uther is in a bit of a strange spot at the moment, as
  he has recently had a spike in his win rate, and at higher level play we've
  been seeing him flexed into the main tank role. We think it's pretty cool that
  heroes can sometimes splash into other roles, but in general Uther is
  overperforming, so we're lowering his Health a bit. On an unrelated note,
  similar to Greymane, Uther's Level 20 talents have long been dominated by one
  choice, in this case Redemption. We're giving the other talents on the tier
  some significant buffs so that they can better compete. We hope that this
  won't increase his win rate significantly as Redemption has always been a
  fairly powerful talent, and are prepared to make adjustments if this ends up
  not being the case.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are intended to limit Samuro's split-
  pushing capabilities, particularly with Illusion Master, as well as increase
  his presence in teamfights. A good Samuro player can be a bit of a pain to
  deal with, particularly when he's spending most of his time macroing and not
  engaging with the enemy team except to swap to a far away clone. These changes
  should make this scenario happen less often, while also giving Samuro more
  rewarding tools for engaging and fighting the enemy team.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incendiary Elixir [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Gilnean Cocktail by 2 seconds. Upon quest completion, reduce the cooldown of Gilnean Cocktail by an additional 2 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gilnean Roulette [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Cursed Bullet by 20 seconds and its damage to 30% of the enemy Hero's current Health.</li>

<li><strong>Tooth and Claw [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Razor Swipe by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For Greymane, we're giving part of Incendiary
  Elixir's cooldown reduction bonus baseline so that the talent gives him some
  baseline power, as well as making it easier for him to complete the quest. In
  addition to this change, we're addressing his Level 20 talent diversity, which
  has not been the best. We're giving 3 of his talents significant buffs so that
  they can compete with Hunter's Blunderbuss, which has traditionally been the
  go-to option. Unleashed now makes it easier to proc Go for the Throat, as well
  as causing those procs to give him significantly more mobility and damage due
  to resetting his cooldowns. For Gilnean Roulette, we're trying the idea of the
  talent changing Cursed Bullet to be more like a 4th Basic Ability that can be
  used multiple times in a teamfight or as a potent poke tool. Finally, Tooth
  and Claw is now also turning Razor Swipe into a significant source of damage.</p>
