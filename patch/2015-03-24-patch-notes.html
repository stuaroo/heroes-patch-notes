<p>We’ve brought Heroes of the Storm offline for a period of extended maintenance
today in order to bring you a brand new Closed Beta patch! Maintenance is
ongoing, but don't worry; we'll let you know just as soon as the Nexus is back
online. In the meantime, you can check out the complete patch notes below.</p>

<p><strong>Update (April 8, 2015):</strong> We released a follow-up patch in order to fix a few bugs and add the ability to pause Custom Games. The April 8 updates have been <em>added in italics</em> to the User Interface and Bug Fixes sections of the patch notes below.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All players’ default Graphic Settings will be re-detected and reset following today’s patch, which may help to address a few performance issues that some players have been experiencing.</li>
<li>Smaller physical memory caps have been introduced for both the 32-bit and 64-bit clients with today’s update, which should mitigate some memory-related issues and make the 64-bit client a more trusted option, even for PCs with less physical RAM.</li>
<li>The “Network Spikes” indicator has been removed from the performance overlay (Ctrl + Alt + F).
<ul>
<li>Network Spikes tracked a number of different metrics at once. While it could indicate performance issues, the number of spikes displayed could also be affected by issues with the local player’s computer, among other things.</li>
<li>In order to avoid further confusion, the Network Spikes indicator has been removed, and will be replaced by additional performance metrics in a future update, which should help players better identify more common performance issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>For more information on some of these changes, please read the Performance section of our</em> <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/18296205"><em>recent blog on Community Conversations</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-battleground">New Battleground</h3>

<p><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong>, a brand new 3-lane Battleground, has been added to Heroes of the Storm and is now available for play in all game modes!</p>

<ul>
<li>Spider Minions and enemy Heroes will drop magical Gems of Power upon death.
<ul>
<li>Collect these Gems and turn them in to the Spider Queen’s Altars, which can be found in-between lanes at the center of the Battleground.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once either team has relinquished enough Gems to the Spider Queen, her Webweavers will descend and travel down each lane to siege the opposing team on three fronts.
<ul>
<li>Each team can summon Webweavers by turning in 50 Gems. The number of required Gems will increase by 5 for each subsequent wave.</li>
<li>Be sure to turn in Gems promptly! Gems collected by a player will be dropped upon death, but can be picked up by allied Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Team League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Initial implementation for Team League, the second mode of Ranked play in Heroes of the Storm, has been added to the game! Read on for an overview of the most competitive game mode in Heroes of the Storm, and then check out <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/18390551">our recent Team League blog post</a> for a much more in-depth look at the feature.
<ul>
<li>With Team League, players can create named teams with dedicated rosters in order to participate in ranked, competitive Heroes of the Storm matches as a group against other teams of similar skill.</li>
<li>In order to participate in Team League, players must meet the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>Reach Level 40.</li>
<li>Own 10 or more Heroes (weekly free rotation Heroes do not count toward this requirement.)</li>
<li>Create or join a team that has at least five members logged in and ready to play in Team League.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Team Creation and Management</strong>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Team League Play Screen, click an empty team slot, enter a team name, and pay 1,000 Gold to create a new team.
<ul>
<li>Players may participate in up to 3 teams at any given time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Team League Screen will display all teams that a player is currently participating in, as well as each team’s current Rank, team name, and Win/Loss record.
<ul>
<li>Using the “Roster” button, a team owner may invite up to 8 other players to join the team’s roster.</li>
<li>In order to play Team League matches, five members from the same team must enter the queue together.
<ul>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A “Ranked Teams” section has been added to the Player Profile.

<li>The team owner can also use this screen to add or remove members, as well as disband the team.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Draft Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Team League matches will use the “First Come, First Served” version of Draft Mode, rather than Hero League’s “Predetermined” Draft Mode.
<ul>
<li>With First Come, First Served Draft Mode, players on each team are free to select Heroes in any order when it is their team’s turn to pick.</li>
<li>A coin toss will still precede the draft phase, and teams will still alternate picking Heroes in 1-2-2-2-2-1 format.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ranked Play and Draft Mode</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Draft Mode Notification</strong>
<ul>
<li>While tabbed out of Heroes of the Storm during a ranked queue, the player will be tabbed back into the client and a notification sound will play when a match is found.</li>
