<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Cho’gall has Arrived to the Nexus!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cho’gall is a unique new addition to Heroes of the Storm who requires two players to team up, each queuing as either Cho or Gall, in order to play together as one hero.
<ul>
<li>Learn more about Cho’gall by reviewing the New Hero section below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cho’gall Awarded to BlizzCon Attendees</strong>
<ul>
<li>All players who attended BlizzCon 2015, or purchased a Virtual Ticket, will permanently receive Cho’gall in their Hero Collections.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unlock Cho’gall by Playing with Friends</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cho’gall cannot be purchased using Gold or real money.</strong></li>
<li>Instead, players who don’t own the two-headed ogre can unlock him by completing a brand new Special Event Quest!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Special Event Quest: Cho’gall Buddy Brawl</strong>
<ul>
<li>Win 2 Games as Cho or Gall while partied with a player who owns Cho’gall to permanently unlock the Hero.</li>
<li>Win 4 games as Cho or Gall while partied with players who have not yet unlocked the hero to earn 2,200 Gold.
<ul>
<li>Those who own Cho’gall may only earn this gold reward once. However, they can still help as many other players unlock the hero as they wish.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hallow’s End has… Ended!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19909253">The Hallow’s End celebration</a> has come to a close, and the following items are no longer available:
<ul>
<li>The Hallow’s End Special Event Quest can no longer be completed, and the portrait reward it offered can no longer be earned.</li>
<li>The Hallow’s End and Ultimate Hallow’s End Bundles have been removed from the in-game Shop.</li>

<h3 id="new-battleground">New Battleground</h3>

<p><strong>Towers of Doom</strong></p>

<p>The Grave Keeper and Raven Lord have risen over a dark and mysterious city,
each seeking to add it to the territories under their control. Now, these
Realm Lords call upon the aid of Heroes in their battle for dominance over the
Towers of Doom.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Please note:</strong> Towers of Doom is not currently available in the live version of Heroes of the Storm, as PTR testing has not yet concluded. Click here for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Core on this Battleground is surrounded by an indestructible barrier, and cannot be razed by Heroes, Minions, or Mercenaries.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead, Heroes must capture the Altars that periodically activate within the city. Upon doing so, each of the Bell Towers controlled by the capturing team will fire a payload that damages the opposing Core.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bell Tower allegiance is fickle! A Bell Tower that has been destroyed will respawn after a short delay, aligning itself with the team that took it down.
<ul>
<li>Toppling a Bell Tower not only increases a team’s area of control over the Battleground, but also grants an additional payload in the volleys that fire on the enemy Core after capturing an Altar.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Towers of Doom Available Now on PTR</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Towers of Doom is the only Battleground available for play in PTR matchmaking queues.
<ul>
<li>Battleground pools on the PTR have been reduced so that more thorough Towers of Doom playtesting can be done, and any bugs discovered during this time can be fixed before the Battleground is officially released.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Please note:</strong> Towers of Doom will not be available in the live version of Heroes immediately on patch day, but will remain playable on the PTR until playtesting concludes on November 24. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design-amp-gameplay">Design &amp; Gameplay</h3>

<p><strong>Scaling Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health and damage scaling for all Heroes, Battleground Events, Minions, and Mercenaries has been changed from flat, additive values to values that are multiplicative by percentage.</li>
<li>A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked.  This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead.  We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios.   As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level.  Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously.   The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game.  Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game.  It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Respawn Timers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.
<ul>
<li>Please review our recent <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095">blog on scaling and respawn timer changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> In order to reward players for getting early game
  Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low
  levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with
  it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead,
  early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy
  enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries.
  These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory,
  without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the
  opposing enemy team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attack Speed Slows</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tooltips</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Several tooltips that lacked specific details regarding delays, charges gained, etc., have been updated with exact details.</li>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Haunted Mines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This Battleground has been removed from all matchmaking queues for the foreseeable future, but is still playable in Custom Games</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> We’ll be adding Towers of Doom to the map pool in
  an upcoming patch. This will expand the size of our map pool to 10 total
  Battlegrounds. To prevent the number of maps we have available to players in
  Quick Match and Hero League from being overbearing, we’ve decided to
  temporarily rotate out Haunted Mines. We feel the number of maps we have
  available are reaching a threshold that we may not be comfortable with.</p>

<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>

<p><strong>Gathering Power</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hero takedowns now increase Ability Power by 2% per kill, up to a maximum of 30%. All stacks are now also lost upon death.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> We wanted to make Gathering Power a more high
  risk, high reward talent that encouraged specific gameplay. Now, with a much
  higher cap, the reward for this talent is much higher. The counterplay becomes
  the burden of the opposing team, as they’ll need to focus the Hero who has
  Gathering Power to reset their stacks.</p>

  now gain a more substantial damage boost if he is able to stick to his target
  for a few seconds.</p>

<h4 id="kharazim">Kharazim</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Insight (Trait)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mana regeneration granted on every third hit increased from 12 (+0.21 per level) to 14 (+0.36 per level)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Iron Fists (Trait)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus granted on every third hit increased from 100% to 125%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Most Kharazim players pick Transcendence at level
  1, and this is often the most powerful option regardless of the situation. We
  tuned up the other two options here to help provide Kharazim players with
  different options.</p>

<h4 id="uther">Uther</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eternal Devotion (Trait)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spirit form duration decreased from 10 to 8 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Shield (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 70 to 90 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> Uther is highly contested at high levels of
  competitive play, so we wanted to target a few nerfs that would have a larger
  impact at that level. We also wanted to focus our changes on two abilities
  that offer very little counterplay for the enemy team.</p>

<h4 id="leoric">Leoric</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Drain Hope (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown decreased from 12 to 11 seconds</li>
<li>If Leoric is stunned while casting Drain Hope, the stun will no longer cancel the Ability and the missile will continue to travel</li>
<li>Damage dealt and Health gained reduced from 25% to 20%</li>
<li>Damage and Healing no longer gradually increase over the Ability’s duration, but instead does a consistent amount of damage and healing with each tick.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Developer Comments:</em></strong> We wanted to remove the scaling damage and heal
  amount on Drain Hope, but knew the change alone would be a significant buff as
  much of the value is loaded at the end of the ability. In response, we lowered
  this value by 5% and also reduced the cooldown by 1 second.</p>
