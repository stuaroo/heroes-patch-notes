</ul>

<ul>
<li>A new Healing Fountain icon has been added to the right of the Hero portrait to indicate whether Healing Fountains are available for use, or on cooldown.</li>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="design-amp-gameplay">Design &amp; Gameplay</h3>

<p><strong>A.I. Talent Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. controlled Heroes will now select their Talents from a group of preset Talent builds.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> A.I. players will now choose from predetermined
  Talent builds instead of randomly selecting Talents. This is especially
  important for players who disconnect as the A.I. will now no longer randomly
  choose Talents, but instead try to pick builds that are closer to what players
  would expect. In addition, A.I. controlled Heroes in Versus A.I. games will
  also have their own Talent builds to choose from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vehicles and Regeneration Globe Interaction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Regeneration Globes will no longer heal Dragon Knights and Garden Terrors.
<ul>
<li>Instead, Regeneration Globe effects will now be applied directly to the Hero inside the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players within a Dragon Knight or Garden Terror can now also accumulate stacks for Talents such as Seasoned Marksman, Gathering Power, Regeneration Master, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summoned Unit Attacks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will now miss if that Summon is Blinded or the target is Evading.</li>
<li>Summoned unit Basic Attacks will no longer consume Block Talent stacks.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Dragon Shire and Sky Temple Battlegrounds have received several A.I. improvements.
<ul>
<li>A.I. controlled Heroes can now travel long distances more effectively, and will travel to take part in objectives from anywhere on the Battleground.</li>
<li>A.I. controlled Heroes will now wait near an objective until enough allies have arrived that they can commit to a team fight at that objective.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Try Mode Updates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The allied Hall of Storms has been moved much closer to the Gate.</li>
<li>The size of the Try Mode Battleground has been increased to accommodate a new playable area below the lane.
<ul>
<li>Siege and Bruiser Mercenary Camps have been added.</li>
<li>A Target Dummy has been added.
<ul>
<li>When attacking the Target Dummy, a new panel will display on-screen that will track damage per second and total damage dealt to the Dummy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Try Mode in-game controls have been reworked and moved to the left-hand side of the screen. Additionally, several new Try Mode controls have been added, and others have been updated:
<ul>
<li><strong>Toggle Ally</strong> – Enable or disable Malfurion in-lane</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Cooldowns</strong> – Enable to remove Ability cooldowns</li>
<li><strong>Set Level</strong> – Drag the slider to select the desired level, up to 30.</li>
<li><strong>Reset Talents</strong> – Click to reselect all Talents</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try Mode will now remember which settings were selected during the previous game, and will apply them when entering a new Try Mode game.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Immortal</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage increased from 360 (+22 per minute) to 360 (+25 per minute) after 11 minutes have passed, and 360 (+30 per minute) after 16 minutes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Matches on Battlefield could occasionally go quite
  long as the Immortals weren’t scaling high enough into the late game. With
  this slight damage increase they’ll be more of a threat as the game
  progresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Garden of Terror</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Garden Terror</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overgrowth (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now also disables the enemy Core</li>
<li>Health now increases the longer the game progresses</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We didn’t like the gameplay of Garden Terrors
  being used defensively to slow down an enemy Garden Terror push. Now that the
  Overgrowth can disable the Core, it will be much less effective to defend as a
  Garden Terror, encouraging teams to be more offensive with their Garden
  Terrors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Punisher</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting and scaling Health decreased by 10%</li>
<li>Now leap to the nearest enemy Hero within range, rather than selecting one at random</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skeletal Defenders</strong>
<ul>
<li>The amount of Skeletal Defenders required to summon a Punisher has been increased from 30 to 40.</li>
<li>Skeletal Defenders will no longer take increased damage from abilities and talents that deal bonus damage to minions.</li>
<li>The range at which Skeletal Defenders will detect and attack players has been decreased by 25%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Player feedback has been centered around how hard
  it is to comeback when falling behind on Infernal Shrines. We agree that the
  Punishers are overly punishing, so we’re nerfing their Health slightly. Teams
  that successfully bait the Punishers deep within their base will be able to
  put an end to this threat sooner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Sky Temple</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Events in which all three Temples activate simultaneously will no longer occur.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> While the three temple event could be fun, it
  didn’t leave the defending team with many options. It almost always meant
  whoever had the advantage at that point in time could secure the majority of
  the temples and win the match with little for the other team to do.</p>

<h3 id="assassin">Assassin</h3>

<h4 id="the-butcher">The Butcher</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ruthless Onslaught (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Savage Charge (Talent)
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage changed from 15% of the target’s current Health to 10% of the target’s maximum Health</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lamb to the Slaughter (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>New art has been added that will better indicate which players are affected by Lamb to the Slaughter</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’d like to avoid ‘current Health’ for the Savage
  Charge Talent, as what players get out of this can vary wildly. Using Savage
  Charge against a low Health target could net less than a Basic Attack, so the
  damage will be much more consistent with this change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="zeratul">Zeratul</h4>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage reduced from 47 (+13 per level) to 47 (+12 per level)</li>
<li><strong>Blink (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wormhole (Talent)
<ul>
<li>Blink reactivation time reduced from 3 to 2 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Void Prison (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Casting range reduced by 50%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Zeratul is a little bit too strong, especially at
  competitive and tournament level play. Wormhole remains extremely powerful,
  but decreasing this timer from 3 to 2 seconds will give increased counter play
  options to the enemy team, primarily if they can disable Zeratul during this
  shorter time window. Void Prison remains one of the most powerful Heroics in
  the game, but with the decreased range, Zeratul will now likely have to use
  Blink or aggressive positioning to get into place for the perfect Void Prison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h3 id="specialist">Specialist</h3>

<h4 id="abathur">Abathur</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Locust Strain (Trait)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Locusts will no longer spawn as soon as the game begins, and will now wait until the first Minion wave spawns</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evolve Monstrosity (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pressing R with a Monstrosity active will now automatically cast Symbiote on the Monstrosity and move your camera to its position</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

  until Minions spawned. This change will allow Abathur to get in position

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> It’s important that Tassadar players can queue for
  Quick Match and not be worried that they are going to cause a negative
  experience for their team. A Tassadar player who chooses the Support Talents
  will be much more viable as a Support character. We still expect Tassadar to
  put out smaller numbers when compared to the highest healing Supports, but
  with the huge amount of utility Tassadar brings, we think this is an okay
  trade off. The second change here targets Archon providing a little too much
  power; we’ve reduced some numbers to tune him appropriately. Internally, we’ve
  seen more Force Wall play as a result, which has been exciting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We think that it’s important that Tyrande has the
  capability to be a viable solo healer, as she might be the only Support on
  your team in Quick Match. Shadowstalk is generally an under-picked Heroic, so
  we decided to focus it more toward healing so that it can become a “support”
  option. Tyrande still brings less healing than some of our other Supports due
  to the rest of her kit, but we hope that the Shadowstalk change will bring her
  closer to what players expect when fulfilling the primary Support role.</p>
