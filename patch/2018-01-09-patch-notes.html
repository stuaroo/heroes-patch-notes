<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just arrived along with Blaze, Veteran
Firebat.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="new-hero-blaze">New Hero: Blaze</h3>

<p>Cpl. Miles "Blaze" Lewis has always been drawn to the flame, but it wasn't
until he joined up with Raynor's Raiders that he put his pyromania to good
use. He's seen his fair share of battles since then, and has never failed to
bring the heat.</p>

<p><strong>Trait</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pyromania</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gain 25 Armor and deal 40 damage to nearby enemies every 0.5 seconds for 4 seconds. Each Hero hit by Flame Stream reduces Pyromania's cooldown by 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flame Stream (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fire two streams of flame that deal 83 damage to enemies hit. Flame Stream sets fire to Oil Spills it comes in contact with.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Oil Spill (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vector Targeting. </li>
<li>Dispense a slick of oil that lasts for 5 seconds and Slows enemies that come in contact with it by 40%. Flame Stream can set Oil Spills on fire for 2.5 seconds, dealing 18 damage every 0.3 seconds to enemies inside. While on fire, Oil Spills no longer Slow enemies. Additionally, Blaze is Healed for 49 Health every 0.3 seconds while standing in flaming Oil Spills. Stores up to 2 charges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Jet Propulsion (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>After 0.5 seconds, charge forward, colliding with the first enemy Hero hit, dealing 52 damage to them and nearby enemy Heroes. Enemies hit are also Stunned for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bunker Drop (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>After 0.5 seconds, deploy and enter a Bunker with 1300 Health. Blaze and his allies can enter and exit the Bunker at will. While in the Bunker, occupants gain access to Flamethrower, dealing 179 damage to enemies in a line. Exiting the Bunker grants 25 Armor for 2 seconds. Bunkers last 10 seconds, or until destroyed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Combustion (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Channel up to 2.6 seconds. Once Channeling ends, nearby enemies are Slowed by 60% and take 48 damage every 0.5 seconds. Combustion's Slow and damage over time durations are extended the longer Blaze Channels, from 1 second up to 5 seconds. Blaze's Movement Speed is reduced by 50% while Channeling.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As expected, our gameplay update for 2018 resulted in
  large changes to many of our game systems. While we’re overall happy with the
  direction of the update, there have been some unintended side effects that
  we’re hoping to remedy. We overestimated how much more powerful unlimited ammo
  would be for Structures, and as a result pushing mechanics have become too
  strong, resulting in lower game times on nearly all maps. We’re giving our
  towers some of their teeth back with this update, which should help teams hold
  pushes from Mercenary Camps and map events. We’re also making some tuning
  changes to some of our Mercenary Camps now that we have had some time to see
  how they have been performing. Hellbats and Knights in particular are pushing
  harder than we would like, so we’re reducing their power. We’re also taking a
  look at the Warhead Junction boss and reducing its early and mid-game pushing
  power, as right now it is too strong when combined with Nukes from the map
  event. Lastly, we are reducing the power of Regeneration Globes. While we like
  the new mini-game that Neutral Regen globes provide in the laning phase, we
  are not comfortable with how much they are currently benefitting the team that
  is ahead while they are pushing into a defending team. We’re also seeing
  players picking up more Regeneration Globes in general, so this will help to
  keep the game’s overall sustain in check. These are some hefty changes, and
  it’s likely that there will be more needed to be done over time as things
  continue to settle. We’ll be keeping an eye on things, and are prepared to
  make more updates as they’re needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re reducing the spread of Scatter Arrows so that
  they’re more effective when opponents aren’t directly next to a wall, while
  also reducing the damage slightly to compensate. We’ve increased the range of
  Natural Agility so that it will jump over a wider variety of terrain. We’ve
  also removed Shieldbreaker because we found that it required a very specific
  set of circumstances to be effective, but it was extremely powerful in those
  rare situations. We’ve moved Sharpened Arrowheads to replace it while changing
  its functionality to be more consistent in all situations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It’s nice to see that the recent changes to Nova have
  been so widely embraced by players. However, with the addition of some new
  escape tools and her ability to have multiple clones out at once, we feel like
  her damage potential against single targets is still a bit too high. Our data
  is showing that her talent tree is in a very good spot balance wise (besides a
  couple outliers, which you see here) so we are also lowering her base output
  and compensating by increasing Precision Sniper’s damage.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Zeratul currently has the lowest win rate out of all
  of our Stealth characters, so we’re tuning up some of his underperforming
  talents. He traditionally has been a high performer as players learn to master
  him, so we will be keeping an eye on him over time to see if he needs any more
  changes.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While the changes to Groundbreaker have helped
  Garrosh feel better to play against, we believe he can use some help with his
  ability to peel for his team and control the battlefield. We’re also making
  some tuning changes to his talents to help their pick and win rates.</p>
