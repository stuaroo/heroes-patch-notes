<p>We just released a new patch for Heroes of the Storm, which marks Tracer’s
pre-release, and brings a number of balance changes, UI improvements, and bug
fixes to the game. Check out the patch notes below.</p>

<h3 id="tracer-pre-release">Tracer Pre-Release</h3>

<p><strong>Tracer, Agent of Overwatch,</strong> is now available to <a href="http://battle.net/heroes/blog/20081853">players who pre-purchased a digital copy of Overwatch: Origins Edition</a> via Battle.net! Read below for a brief overview of her Abilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Tracer will become available for purchase from the in-game Shop for all players starting <strong>Tuesday, April 26</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trait</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reload (D)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your Basic Attacks can be fired while moving, and each shot costs ammo.</li>
<li>After attacking 10 times, you will automatically Reload your ammo over 0.75 seconds. You can activate Reload to manually replenish your ammo at any time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blink (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dash a short distance. Stores up to 3 charges. 6 second charge cooldown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Melee (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deal damage to an enemy at close range, prioritizing Heroes.</li>
<li>Generates 5% of your Pulse Bomb charge when striking an enemy, and 10% when striking an enemy Hero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recall (E)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bound backward in time, returning to the position you were in 3 seconds ago, instantly reloading your ammo, and removing all negative status effects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pulse Bomb (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lob a short-range bomb that will adhere to the terrain or the first enemy it hits. The bomb explodes after 1.5 seconds, dealing heavy damage to an enemy caught at the center of the blast, and half-damage to enemies nearby.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="system-changes">System Changes</h3>

<p><strong>Matchmaking</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Match</strong>
<ul>
<li>The matchmaking system will now account for each player’s Hero level in order to better define match quality and calculate win probabilities more accurately when attempting to create Quick Match games.
<ul>
<li>As a result, players should now be matched with and against players of slightly lower skill when playing a Hero for the first time, and slightly higher skill when playing Heroes with which they have extensive experience.</li>
<li>This will result in a higher percentage of evenly-matched games, in which each team has a 45% - 55% probability of victory, and should encourage more players to try out a greater variety of Heroes in Quick Match games.</li>
<li>Additionally, this change will have minimal impact on Quick Match queue times, except for those at the extreme ends of the MMR spectrum.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>Draft Lobby</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hovering the cursor over another player’s portrait after they have picked a Hero in the draft lobby will now display a tooltip that lists the name of the selected Hero Skin.
<ul>
<li>The tooltip will also indicate the Hero’s role, and whether they use ranged or melee Basic Attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A warning icon will now appear on players’ Hero portraits in the draft lobby when pre-selecting a Hero that they are unable to lock-in.
<ul>
<li>This icon will also be visible to all teammates in order to better indicate when a player is unable to lock-in the Hero they’ve pre-selected.</li>
<li>Heroes that have already been picked or banned, do not meet Ranked Play’s level 5 requirement, or are otherwise ineligible for selection by that player will cause this icon to appear.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In-Game UI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Score Screen</strong>
<ul>
<li>A “Mute Player Pings” button has been added to the in-game Score Screen (TAB) to the left of the “Mute Player Chat" button.
<ul>
<li>Additionally, “Mute Pings” and “Mute All” options have been added to the player context menu, accessed by clicking the Cog button to the right of the “Mute Player Chat” button.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blocking a player will now automatically mute that player’s in-game pings so long as they remain on the Blocked Communication list.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hotkeys</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hotkey settings have been added for the “/Taunt” and “/Dance” chat commands, which can now be used to issue these emotes at the press of a single button.
<ul>
<li>The “/Taunt” and “/Dance” hotkey settings default to Numpad 1 and 2, respectively, and can be found under the Hero Management header on the Advanced Hotkeys settings pane.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Hold Position Hotkey (Default: H) now also functions as a Hold Fire command.
<ul>
<li>Issuing a Hold Fire command (H) will now immediately stop the Hero from using Basic Attacks, cancel the current movement command, and prevent the Hero from acquiring a new target until another order is issued.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="shop">Shop</h3>

<li>Elven Fates Bundle</li>
<li>Ultimate Elven Fates Bundle</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Butcher’s</strong> prices have been reduced to $8.49 USD and 7,000 Gold.</li>

<p><strong>Mounts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The 2016 Spring Champion’s Mount has been added in honor of MVP Black, the 2016 Spring Global Champions.</li>
<li>The Championship Banner’s third Mount Variation has been decorated with maroon and gold in honor of Real Dream Team’s Heroes of the Dorm 2016 victory.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Punisher</strong>
<ul>
<li>Punisher starting Health has been increased, and scaling Health has been reduced to compensate.</li>
<li><strong>Frozen Punisher</strong>
<ul>
<li>Delay between ice trap spawn and detonation decreased from 2.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Root duration while frozen decreased from 2 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Although we are very happy with the current tuning
  of Infernal Shrines, we have been noticing a tendency to under-value the first
  couple of Punishers. In order to help incentivize players into valuing them,
  we have boosted their starting Health and decreased their early scaling values
  to compensate. While early event Punishers should be a bit stronger, any event
  past the 15-minute mark should be identical to those from the previous patch.  </p>
  
  <p>Frozen Punishers are great at zoning enemy teams but we felt they were a bit
  too easy to avoid without preliminary team initiation. These changes should
  increase the frequency in which players get rooted, while feeling a little
  less punishing when this occurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Towers of Doom</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Events in which three Altars spawn at once will now only occur twice per game, during the first and fifth Altar events.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We wanted to remove the triple Altar spawns when
  they are more likely to be game ending events. We still feel that triple Altar
  events offer interesting gameplay moments that ask teams to fight over 3
  locations at the same time, but we don’t feel it’s a good experience when a
  team's Core Health is low and they don’t think they can contest the Altars to
  prevent a loss.</p>

<h3 id="assassin">Assassin</h3>

<h4 id="greymane">Greymane</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gilnean Cocktail(Q) (D)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Incendiary Elixir (Talent) has been redesigned as a Quest Talent that reads as follows:
<ul>
<li>Every time you damage an enemy Hero with the splash damage from Gilnean Cocktail, increase the impact damage by 2 and the splash damage by 6 (stacks up to 20 times). Once you’ve hit 20 Heroes, also reduce Gilnean Cocktail’s cooldown by 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> The idea behind Gilnean Cocktail is that it can do
  a lot of damage, but the downside is that the primary target takes a lot less.
  It’s designed to be a poking tool to kill the backline. The old version of
  Incendiary Elixir completely blew out that concept, and instead made the
  ability a simple area of effect nuke that wasn’t special anymore. We’ve
  replaced it with this new Incendiary Elixir that rewards players who can show
  mastery of this skill shot’s unique aspects, while preserving the skill cap of
  the ability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h3 id="warrior">Warrior</h3>

<h4 id="artanis">Artanis</h4>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2335 (+4% per level) to 2245 (+4% per level).</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from approximately 4.86 (+4% per level) to 4.67 (+4% per level).</li>
<li><strong>Twin Blades (W)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Artanis’ next Basic Attack now also causes him to charge forward a short distance, equal to approximately half the distance provided by the previous iteration of the Zealot Charge Talent.</li>
<li>Zealot Charge (Talent)
<ul>
<li>Now increases charge distance by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Artanis’ survivability directly scales with how
  much uptime he has, which made a Talent like Zealot Charge incredibly
  powerful. The effect brought his entire kit together so well, that we’ve
  decided to provide part of its former benefit into baseline Twin Blades.
  Whereas sometimes we feel the need to cut Talents to fill a hole in a Hero’s
  kit, in this case we think that this is a hole that Artanis’ should be able to
  partially circumvent from the start. Since this is a substantial increase in
  his power at the start of the game, we’ve decided to revert the Health
  increase that Artanis received recently.</p>
</blockquote>
