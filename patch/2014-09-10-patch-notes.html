<p><em><strong>Update - Sept. 16, 2014:</strong></em></p>

<p><em>We released a follow-up patch today, September 16, which included a variety of bug fixes. Today's additions have been included in italics in the Bug Fixes section below.</em></p>

<p>We've brought the Heroes of the Storm service down for a period of extended maintenance today in order to release a brand new patch for the Technical Alpha. Maintenance is ongoing, but don't worry; we'll let you know as soon as the Nexus is back online! In the meantime, you can check out complete patch notes below.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>64-Bit Client Now Available</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A 64-bit version of the Technical Alpha Client is now available on 64-bit systems.
<ul>
<li>The 64-bit version of the Heroes client allows the game to utilize available RAM beyond 4GB, reducing the risk of Out-of-Memory errors.</li>
<li>To use the 64-bit client, please follow the steps below:
<ul>
<li>Launch the Battle.net App and click the Battle.net icon in the top left corner of the app.</li>
<li>Click “Settings” from the dropdown list, and then select “Game Settings” from the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Next, find Heroes of the Storm on the Game Settings menu and uncheck the box labeled “Launch 32-bit client.”</li>
<li>Finally, click “Done” in the lower right, and then launch Heroes of the Storm to begin using the 64-bit Technical Alpha client.</li>
<li>To return to using the 32-bit version of the Heroes client, simply re-check the box labeled “Launch 32-bit client” in the Game Settings menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Further improvements for the 64-bit client will be included in future updates.</li>
<li>Please also note that the 64-bit Heroes client is currently available only for Windows users. A Mac version of the 64-bit client will be available in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em><a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/15787794">Check out our recent blog post</a> for more details on the 64-bit Heroes client.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Streaming Downloader</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Much like other Blizzard games, Heroes of the Storm now makes use of streaming technology when updating to the latest version of the game. This means that players will be able get in-game and start playing Heroes even if an update has not finished downloading.
<ul>
<li>While downloading game data, a progress bar will now appear at the bottom of the Heroes of the Storm page on the Battle.net App.</li>
<li>The progress bar will change colors to indicate current download status, as well as the earliest possible moment that the game becomes playable.</li>
<li>The following progress bar colors represent each download state.
<ul>
<li><strong>Red:</strong> Core game content is being downloaded. The game is not playable during this time.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Heroes is now available for play, though not all game content has been applied.</li>
<li><strong>Green:</strong> Final game content is nearly complete.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the Heroes client is launched prior to completing the entire update, the game will continue downloading data in the background during gameplay until the update is finished.
<ul>
<li>In some cases, low-resolution textures may be displayed in-game while high-quality assets continue downloading in the background. Often, players will not even notice that this is occurring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Please note, that Bug Fixes listed in <strong>ITALICS</strong> below were added with a follow-
up patch, released on <strong>Tuesday, September 16.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>General</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Corrected a number of issues with the Ability Auto-Queuing system.</em></li>
<li><em>Download progress should no longer hang while updating to the latest version of Heroes of the Storm.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue which could cause some Heroes to momentarily enter a locked state when attempting to cast several abilities in quick succession.</em></li>
<li><em>A desync should no longer occur while using the 32-bit Heroes client and playing with others using a Mac or the 64-bit Heroes client.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Heroes</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Abathur can now properly turn in Doubloons that were collected while using Ultimate Evolution after the ability expires.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected an exploit in which Abathur could use Ultimate Evolution to duplicate Doubloons.</em></li>
