          <blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're currently doing a pass on our Warriors, and
  want to better separate those that are intended to be able to solo-tank for
  their team, and those who are better identified as bruisers. With Armor coming
  into the game, we also saw an opportunity to make our Warriors have unique
  roles for their team so that the strongest or most survivable few weren't
  identified and always favored regardless of the enemy team composition. In
  this patch, we've taken a pass at both Arthas and Anub'arak to better embrace
  their roles as solo-Warriors for their team. They have both received
  significant changes, largely with the theme of adding control and/or
  survivability to their kits at the cost of damage. While we know that players
  enjoy putting out that DPS, we think this is a healthier direction for the
  game, and should make the decision of which Warrior to bring to a team more
  meaningful. We're also hoping that this direction helps push against the trend
  of it being the correct choice to bring multiple Warriors to a team because
  some can bring both CC and survivability while also doing as much damage as
  our Assassins.</p>
  
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak has received some baseline changes and
  talent tweaks to embrace his role as an anti-caster Warrior. New additions to
  his kit include a lower cooldown and slowing Burrow Charge, a buff to his
  Harden Carapace shield amount, and some buffs to his Beetle build.
  Understandably some players may be wondering why we lowered his Spell Armor
  when we want him to be an anti-caster, but we felt that 25 base Spell Armor
  was a little too pointed in countering casters as they have no real options to
  deal with it when it is on a hero baseline. By giving him these changes, we're
  hoping to make him a more well-rounded Warrior while still filling a niche
  that previously did not exist in our game.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're currently doing a pass on our Warriors, and
  want to better separate those that are intended to be able to solo-tank for
  their team, and those who are better identified as bruisers. With Armor coming
  into the game, we also saw an opportunity to make our Warriors have unique
  roles for their team so that the strongest or most survivable few weren't
  identified and always favored regardless of the enemy team composition. In
  this patch, we've taken a pass at both Arthas and Anub'arak to better embrace
  their roles as solo-Warriors for their team. They have both received
  significant changes, largely with the theme of adding control and/or
  survivability to their kits at the cost of damage. While we know that players
  enjoy putting out that DPS, we think this is a healthier direction for the
  game, and should make the decision of which Warrior to bring to a team more
  meaningful. We're also hoping that this direction helps push against the trend
  of it being the correct choice to bring multiple Warriors to a team because
  some can bring both CC and survivability while also doing as much damage as
  our Assassins.</p>
  
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Arthas has walked the line between
  being a Bruiser and a tank, though it was always intended that he be more of a
  tank as opposed to a bruiser. With Armor in the game, we saw the opportunity
  to really embrace him being that slow approach of Death that he encapsulated
  so well in Wrath of the Lich King. Arthas's crowd control capability and
  survivability have been significantly increased, and now he should really
  shine as the Warrior to bring if the enemy team has multiple Melee heroes or
  those who strongly rely on their auto-attacks. In return for his extra control
  in teamfights, his damage has been reduced. While he will not put out damage
  as quickly as before, his ability to kill enemies will now rely much more on
  how long he can keep them in his Frozen Tempest, as once they're in it will be
  very difficult for them to escape without using some kind of mobility.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> When we were first told about the new event "Two
  Heads are Better Than One", we immediately set to work on giving Cho'gall's
  talent trees a much needed face-lift. A lot of our Warriors were getting Armor
  updates in this patch and originally Cho'gall was no exception. After playing
  with a generic form of it internally, we realized we had a once-in-a-Nexus
  opportunity to do something very different and seized the moment. The
  foundation of the Cho'gall rework revolves around their new Traits, Ogre Hide
  and Ogre Rage, which are the keys to success with the Hero. The potential of
  Cho'gall should be greater than ever, but you will have to make sure both
  heads are working together in order to maximize your damage output while
  keeping yourself alive long enough to keep doing it.</p>

          <blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> When we were first told about the new event "Two
  Heads are Better Than One", we immediately set to work on giving Cho'gall's
  talent trees a much needed face-lift. A lot of our Warriors were getting Armor
  updates in this patch and originally Cho'gall was no exception. After playing
  with a generic form of it internally, we realized we had a once-in-a-Nexus
  opportunity to do something very different and seized the moment. The
  foundation of the Cho'gall rework revolves around their new Traits, Ogre Hide
  and Ogre Rage, which are the keys to success with the Hero. The potential of
  Cho'gall should be greater than ever, but you will have to make sure both
  heads are working together in order to maximize your damage output while
  keeping yourself alive long enough to keep doing it.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> I'm not exactly sure where this Goblin keeps
  getting the hoards of gold he needs to bribe the Design team, but sure enough
  he has done it again. The changes to him started off as quality-of-life fixes
  but eventually evolved into something of a minor rework. Overall, we tried to
  even out the power level of a couple talent tiers (including his Heroics),
  while bringing in a swash of baseline changes in order to make him feel a bit
  more user-friendly. We realize his win rate is above average in certain MMR
  brackets (and game modes) and that this may be viewed as a substantial buff to
  him. However, we felt it was important to bring these changes to our players
  and are prepared to act quickly if any tweaks are needed.</p>
