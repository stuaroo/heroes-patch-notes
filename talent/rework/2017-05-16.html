          <blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Your Highlord has returned! Alarak has received a
  large update that he has deemed "acceptable", targeted at making him more
  rewarding for players who take the time to master him. Baseline changes
  include reworking his Sadism to be increased upon getting Takedowns and
  putting bonus damage into his Lightning Surge baseline for hitting enemies in
  its center beam. We're also experimenting with some new talent ideas with
  Extended Lightning and Chaos Reigns, where players can gain huge benefits for
  the rarely accomplished feat of hitting 3 enemy Heroes with a single ability.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> During one of our design meetings many months ago,
  we came to the consensus that we wanted to swap the heal functionality between
  Tyrande and Uther. It felt like the self-heal mechanic was better suited on a
  front-line melee Healer, so we gave it to our favorite paladin in his latest
  rework. Instead of simply removing functionality from Light of Elune, we
  decided to add a large amount of cooldown reduction with every Basic Attack.
  This will reward players that can stay in combat and has allowed us to shift
  some of her power from healing output into more utility and offensive-based
  areas. Overall, we are extremely excited to see what our players can do with
  her new kit and look forward to hearing any feedback you have!</p>
