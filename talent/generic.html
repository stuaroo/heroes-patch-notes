              <h4>Talents</h4>
              <p><strong>Imposing Presence</strong> <strong>(Active)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New functionality:
<ul>
<li>Heroes that attack you have their Attack Speed slowed by 20% for 2.5 seconds</li>
<li>Activate to Slow the Attack Speed of nearby Heroes and Summons by 50% and Slow their Movement Speed by 20% for 2.5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We did not like the power of the Attack Speed slow
  for Imposing Presence given how little counter-play there is. We’ve decided to
  move some power out of the passive portion of the Talent and give it a new
  activated effect in order to create some bigger moments for players who choose
  to take it.</p>
</blockquote>

              <p><strong>Spell Shield</strong> <strong>(Passive)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added functionality:
<ul>
<li>Spell Shield can now be toggled on or off to allow for better control of which Abilities you want to mitigate</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Relentless</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We're removing the majority of our old Relentless-
  like Talents from the game, because we found that it wasn't clear to the enemy
  team what was happening. Reducing the duration on very short disabling effects
  to begin with was hard to notice, and typically felt like a bug when it did
  happen. In some cases, we're replacing these Talents with Hero specific ones
  that more clearly convey what's happening, while fitting the gameplay of the
  Hero.</p>
</blockquote>

              <p><strong>Bribe</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> In our ongoing pursuit to create meaningful and
  Hero-specific generic Talent choices, Bribe was a Talent that got caught in
  our crosshairs this patch. We have removed it from a few Heroes and have added
  new flavorful versions to a few others. We have always liked the design and
  gameplay behind the Talent, but also realize how much players had to give up
  in order to pick them. Wingman, Pixie Charm, and Covert Mission are being
  reintroduced to Falstad, Brightwing, and Nova, respectively, with design
  mechanics more suited to each Hero's unique style of play.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
              <ul>
<li><strong>Calldown: MULE:</strong> Will now properly acquire a new repair target if the Structure it is actively repairing is destroyed.</li>

              <h4>Talents</h4>
              <p><strong>Bribe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Nearby Minion kills grant 1 stack of Bribe. Spend 20 charges to instantly defeat a non-Boss Mercenary. 100 Charges maximum.
<ul>
<li>Raynor’s Raiders' Recruitment Talent also increased to 100 maximum charges.</li>
<li>Viking Bribery Talent increased to 200 charges maximum, but each use costs 40 charges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a Mercenary Camp is completely captured using Bribe, the camp respawns 50% faster.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Executioner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Executioner Talent effect will now only trigger after attacking disabled Heroes. The bonus damage gained through this talent will still apply to anything attacked after the effect is triggered.</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Relentless</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Relentless and similar Hero-specific Talents will now only reduce the duration of Slows, Stuns and Roots. Silence effects will no longer be reduced by this talent. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> With an increasing number of CC effects entering
  the Nexus we found ourselves constantly asking ourselves “Should Relentless
  work against this?” which quickly turned into a rabbit hole of ‘what-ifs’ and
  ‘how comes’. We agreed that the talent was going to continue to become
  stronger as we moved forward and decided to limit the number of effects that
  it can reduce.</p>

<li>No longer reduces Heroic Ability or Trait cooldowns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Our intention for Battle Momentum was to create
  more active gameplay by using your Basic Abilities more often, but we found
  that a lot of this Talent’s power lied in its ability to reduce your Heroic
  cooldowns. We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,
  but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By
  making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed
  us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve
  also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without
  affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature
  of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced.</p>
</blockquote>

              <p><strong>Conjurer's Pursuit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.
<ul>
<li><strong>Quest:</strong> Gather Regeneration Globes to permanently increase Mana Regeneration by 0.10 per second, up to a maximum of 2.5 per second.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> After gathering 25 Regeneration Globes, also increases maximum Mana by 100.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve added a completion point to this Talent.
  Upon completing its quest, players will be provided with some additional
  power. This allows us to offer spikes of power in-between Talent levels, or
  even for a single player on a team. Now, simply picking the Talent and only
  partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger
  reward. Choosing the right Talents on the right Battleground or with the right
  team composition has always been an important goal for us, and this change
  pushes this Talent to closer align with that goal.</p>
</blockquote>

              <p><strong>Executioner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This Talent has been reworked.
<ul>
<li>Increases Basic Attack damage by 30% for 3 seconds after hitting a Stunned, Slowed, or Rooted target with a Basic Attack. Using Basic Attacks against a Slowed, Rooted, or Stunned target during this time will refresh the buff duration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We like the punishing nature of Executioner, but
  have found over time that its benefit to the player is too narrowly scoped.
  We’re changing the Talent to be more consistently useful by giving the player
  a temporary Attack Damage buff that procs when they first hit a crowd
  controlled target.</p>
</blockquote>

              <p><strong>Hardened Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Health bar next to the Hero Portrait will now display a marker that indicates whether the Hero is above or below 80% Health.</li>
<li>Will now display an icon in the Buff bar next to the Hero Portrait while its effects are active.</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Regeneration Master</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.

<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Upon gathering 30 Globes, also increases Health by 500</li>

<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We want to improve counter-pick talents like Block

  they are picked, and that there are more situations where the enemy team’s

<ul>
<li>This Talent has been redesigned</li>
<li>Dampen Magic charges now cause all incoming Ability Damage to be reduced by 50% for 1 second</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Similar to Block, Dampen Magic is the first of
  many efforts we will be making to create more meaningful counter-pick Talents
  (in this case, against spell casters). We found that the original iteration of
  Dampen Magic did not truly fulfill its purpose of mitigating spell damage due
  to how many spell effects are done with incremental damage. This buff should
  make the Talent more universally viable against enemy spells.</p>

  Heroes, but want to bring its overall power down a bit.</p>

              <h4>Talents</h4>
              <p><strong>Bolt of the Storm</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We love this talent and think it can create a lot
  of really interesting moments, but the cooldown was just too short. At 70
  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players
  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use
  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased
  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic
  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Cleanse</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We didn’t like the gameplay of casting Cleanse
  preemptively on a target that is about to be CC’ed. For example, you see
  Butcher charging your Valla, and right before impact you use Cleanse on Valla,
  allowing her to immediately Vault away. The change also prevents healers from
  cleansing themselves preemptively, providing a guaranteed target if the
  opposing team has only secured one Cleanse. As a side note, the original
  reason the Unstoppable functionality was available in the first place, was to
  help alleviate some persistent CC effects like Putrid Bile. We didn’t want you
  to cleanse a Putrid Bile only to have the slow immediately reapply.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No longer makes the target Unstoppable for 1 second</li>
<li>Now adds Relentless to the target for 2 seconds (50% shorter CC duration)</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Focused Attacks</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> This could be viewed as a buff or nerf depending
  on how players perceive it. You can still reduce the cooldown by attacking
  Minions, but won’t accidently waste a burst of damage on an unintended target.
  This talent will no longer be as effective at sieging, but it should be
  significantly better at harassing in lane. We will continue to monitor the
  talent, and tune as necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The increased damage effect will now only trigger when hitting Heroes</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Gathering Power</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Gathering Power was simply too good and was
  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead
  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too
  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,
  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much
  longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help
  act as a ‘check point’.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The 5% starting Ability Power has been removed</li>
<li>Percentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1%</li>
<li>Instead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up)</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Imposing Presence</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Statistically, it was almost never wrong to choose
  Imposing Presence. With this nerf, it’s still a great counter in the right
  situation, and as a result, we’re hoping we’ll see more play from our Basic
  Attack assassins.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Attack Speed slow reduced from 50% to 40%</li>
<li>The Attack Speed slow will now be removed when attacking a target that has not learned the Imposing Presence Talent</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Mercenary Lord</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> We’ve combined the talent Superiority into
  Mercenary Lord, and removed the damage reduction from structures to prevent
  degenerative backdoor strategies. The combination of the damage reduction vs.
  Mercenaries and the ability to empower these Mercenaries felt like a logical
  pairing. We hope incorporating the two talents into one will make this level 4
  choice an enticing one, as the two talents separated had a low pick rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The functionality of the Superiority Talent has been rolled into Mercenary Lord, which is now available to the following Heroes at Level 4:
<ul>
<li>Anub'arak, Arthas, Azmodan, Gazlowe, Nazeebo, Sonya, Stitches, and The Lost Vikings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New combined functionality reads: Non-Boss Mercenaries near your Hero deal 50% more damage. Reduces damage taken from Minions and Mercenaries by 50%.</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Seasoned Marksman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Developer Comments:</strong></em> Overall, we like the way Seasoned Marksman is
  playing but wanted to tune up its effectiveness to reward those able to secure
  a healthy number of takedowns, while simultaneously tuning the talent up due
  to prior changes. Ideally, this will become a great talent pick when facing
  The Lost Vikings or Murky players.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stacks earned by killing enemy Heroes increased from 2 to 3</li>
<li>Only Minions, captured enemy Mercenaries, and Heroes will grant stacks upon death</li>
</ul>

              <p><strong>Superiority</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This Talent has been removed, and its functionality has been rolled into the revamped Mercenary Lord Talent</li>
</ul>

              <h4 class="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
