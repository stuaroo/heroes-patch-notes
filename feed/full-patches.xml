<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legion of Beetles [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown to spawn a Beetle increased from 8 seconds to 12 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cocoon [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 32 to 28</li>
<li>This reduces the time that the Cocoon naturally decays from 8 to 7 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak is still overperforming compared to other
  Warriors, so this time we are reducing the power of Legion of Beetles and
  Cocoon, which are still stand out talents for him. We are hesitant to over-
  nerf him, so our strategy going forward is to combine these smaller nerfs with
  buffs to other Warriors to create a healthier meta for the role.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 1.5 to 1.25 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Blaze has been outperformed by other heroes in the
  last few months, and these changes are intended to bring him a bit more back
  into the meta. Most of these buffs are intended to help his tanking
  capabilities, particularly when it comes to his initiation and survivability.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="etc">E.T.C.</h4>

<p>​<strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bonus damage increased from 35% to 40%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Some of ETC's talents could use some beefing up, so
  we're milking this opportunity to bring ETC more into the meta so he can
  better compete with the likes of Anub'arak, Diablo, and Garrosh. Don't worry,
  if these changes butcher his balance we'll take stock of the situation and
  nerf him appropriately.</p>

<h4 id="garrosh">Garrosh</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wrecking Ball [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 14 to 16 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unrivaled Strength [E]</strong>

<li><strong>Body Check [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slow amount reduced from 30% to 35%</li>
<li>No longer deals bonus damage or Slow amount based on Armor Up's bonus</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Now causes enemies to receive 40% reduced Healing for the next 3 seconds</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brute Force [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed</li>

<li><strong>Decimate [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slow amount increased from 30% to 40%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mortal Combo [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 9 to 10 seconds</li>
<li>Additional Functionality: Now also gives Garrosh cooldown reduction if an enemy Hero is hit by Groundbreaker within 3 seconds of being hit by Wrecking Ball.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadly Calm [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduction increased from 20% to 25%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Garrosh is incredibly popular due to his
  ability to heavily displace enemy Heroes, he is not outperforming other Heroes
  in the game, sitting at a 48% win rate at higher levels of play in the hands
  of people who are skilled with him specifically. At lower levels of play his
  win rate drops to 47.2%, where he wins the award for being the second lowest
  win-rate Warrior in the game. We're slightly nerfing Wrecking Ball's cooldown
  to help address his high popularity and frustrations playing against him, and
  buffing some of his under-picked talents to better compete with their peers to
  help stabilize his talent tree.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Johanna is a solid, versatile Warrior that brings a
  strong frontline presence to her team. In addition to giving her some talent
  buffs, we're increasing the damage of Condemn to further push her unique role
  as a Warrior who brings a considerable amount of waveclear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've nerfed Mal'ganis multiple times since his
  release, and he has fallen off a bit too much since our last round. These
  buffs to various talents are meant to increase his overall effectiveness while
  also rounding out his talent tiers to be more competitive.</p>

<h4 id="imperius">Imperius</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consuming Flame [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus changed from 125% to 100%</li>
<li>This slightly reduces the bonus damage at Level 1 from 281 to 260, but at Level 20 will change from 454 to 54</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flash of Anger [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Consuming a mark from Celestial Charge deals damage around the target and gives Imperius a Shield for 300 over 4 seconds</li>
<li>Damage reduced from 198 to 180</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To make it more consistent with other damage
  modifiers, we are changing Consuming Flame's bonus from a flat amount to a
  percent bonus, which will make it scale with Imperius's level. This is a
  slight nerf to his Level 1 damage, but overall a fairly significant buff to
  the talent during the middle and later portions of the game. To make Flash of
  Anger more reliable, we are changing its functionality to be about consuming
  marks of Celestial Charge instead of trying to hit enemy Heroes first with
  Solarion's Fire. To compensate for the power and reliability bonuses we're
  giving, we are reverting the damage bonus that we gave to the talent last
  patch. This functionality change should make the use case for the talent much
  more clear: Impale enemies, gain benefits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 6% to 8% maximum Health</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We read the feedback that it is difficult to
  capitalize on the cooldown resets on Wraith Strike due to the high Mana cost
  of casting the ability multiple times. To compensate for this, we are
  drastically reducing the Mana cost of Tormented Souls, which should make it
  much easier to get value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since we've reevaluated the
  Firelord's place in the Nexus. Overall he's doing fairly well, but we felt he
  could use a small buff to compete with the current meta heroes in the game. We
  also saw this as an opportunity to help his Level 20 pick rates out, so we're
  buffing Flames of Sulfuron to be a fairly meaningful Stun increase and
  increasing the uptime of Submerge.</p>

<li>Misha's Health Regeneration scaling increased from 4% to 4.75%</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are to make Rexxar's laning phase a little less overwhelming for the majority of opponents, particularly on maps with control points. We're slightly lowering Misha's power in the early game, but increasing her scaling so that she is less powerful in early-game trades, but is still a threat in the mid to late portions of the game.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anduin's Light is bringing victory! Just about
  48% of the time, which is great for a new Hero release. What we're aiming to
  do though is buff up a lot of the lesser chosen Talents on him so that he
  feels like he has a greater variety of options. We're also looking to make
  Bold Strategy a little more bold, and a little less automatic. We're aiming to
  do this by reducing his higher than typical Mana tension baseline (which Bold
  Strategy helped alleviated by increasing Flash Heal's cooldown and making his
  healing more efficient), while also increasing the cooldown penalty for Bold
  Strategy. This is in addition to buffing up the other two Talents on the tier,
  which also buffs Bold Strategy. Net result is that Pursued by Grace and Renew
  will give Anduin a little more consistent healing, and potentially open up
  synergy with the significantly buffed Binding Heal at level 7.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some quality of life changes to some of
  Stukov's talents to make them better. Targeted Excision in particular suffered
  from some awkwardness where when used properly, the cooldown of Bio-Kill
  Switch would often be lower than the cooldowns of his Healing Pathogen and
  Weighted Pustule, which made part of its benefit meaningless. This change
  should make its 5-second cooldown more important, as he can use his other
  abilities sooner after his initial cast of Bio-Kill Switch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are meant to create better competition
  between Alarak's Level 4 talents. We are buffing Chaos Reigns and giving Show
  of Force an exciting new scaling bonus, while also reducing the power of
  Negatively Charged. While we realize that Negatively Charged is an extremely
  attractive talent that can sometimes get out of control when Alarak gets a lot
  of stacks, and an obvious way to nerf it would be to cap its stacks, a large
  part of the enjoyment of playing Alarak and of taking talents like Negatively
  Charged is about living the dream when playing well. We are instead going to
  try simply reducing the bonus and making the other talents on the tier more
  attractive, which should hopefully help talent picks on other tiers as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rain of Destruction has not been the predominant
  Heroic since Gul'dan's release. We believe there are two reasons for this: the
  first being that it has some randomness to its output in regards to where the
  meteors land, and the second being that it requires Gul'dan to channel for 7
  seconds, which gives his opponents an incredibly long time to interrupt him
  while also not allowing him to use his other abilities or provide any other
  output during that time. We're targeting the second issue with this change,
  which will allow Gul'dan to gain the ability to move and use his abilities
  while the Rain of Destruction is happening. We may in the future look at the
  randomness of the Heroic's meteors, but at this time we want to try this
  change as it retains most of the original fantasy of Gul'dan raining Hellfire
  upon his enemies. We're also improving some of Gul'dan's lesser picked
  talents. We realize that he has some fundamental issues with Corruption
  focused talents dominating his talent tree, and are looking at exploring ways
  in the future to make alternative ways to play more meaningfully competitive.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are designed to bring the 3 types of Punishers more closely aligned in power, while preserving what makes them special. Mortar is now a properly scary amount of damage up front, while Arcane had its damage reduced but maintains the highest damage over a long period of time. Frozen has had structure disabled added to it, further encouraging teams to dive into enemy towns alongside him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making these changes to the Triglav Protector to shift a little of the vehicles power out of its team fight potential, and into its pushing power (particularly in the early game). We believe that it has to have some teeth to discourage enemies from committing to a team fight when it pushes, but its capability to nuke someone from almost full health was a little too powerful. We've changed Rocket Fist's root into a knockback to make landing all its abilities more difficult as well, but still force enemies to disengage when it connects. We've also taken this time to adjust some of the scaling of the Protector, so that it follows a more typical power curve in relation to Heroes, Minions, and Mercenaries. We've removed the Swap Vehicle button as well. While it was cool, it was a hold out from the previous undesired gameplay of a solo player controlling both seats of a vehicle that we discouraged via the Spell Power buff to both seats being occupied.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes and bug
fixes! Read on for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>The party size of enemies will no longer be shown during the match loading screen</li>
<li>Removed all party-size restrictions during the matchmaking process</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes should help address both queue times
  for certain party sizes while also removing the pre-game bias that forms when
  facing parties of players that may be larger than your own. In order to ensure
  fair matches are created, one of the variables used to determine whether a
  match has an acceptable win probability is the party size. In the event the
  party sizes across both teams aren't equal ([5]vs[1-1-1-1-1] for example),
  other variables will be weighted differently to make sure the match created is
  balanced. One example of this is that a team of [5] may have a lower MMR vs a
  team of [1-1-1-1-1] to help balance out the advantage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As we promised in the past, we took a look at the
  overall Mana tension of all the Heroes in the game. We also have some
  philosophies about Mana that we want to keep going forward. They are:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Mana should be a meaningful part of the game, particularly in the early
  stages when wave clear is at a higher premium. We believe that as the game
  progresses, Mana tension should become less important as Heroes gain more base
  Mana and the game's focus shifts to team fighting.</p></li>
  <li><p>Mana tension doesn't have to be the same for every Hero, but every Hero
  should feel it to some degree, otherwise it serves no purpose.</p></li>
  <li><p>We like that some talents heavily mitigate Mana tension.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>When we took a look at Mana tension in the game, we saw that, overall,
  things are in a fairly healthy spot, but could be fine-tuned and improved
  upon. We like the tension that the heroes who are closer to the middle of the
  spectrum have, with some examples being Malfurion, Tychus, and E.T.C. Our goal
  with these changes is to bring the outliers closer to the center. We are open
  to your feedback going forward if you think that the game needs to be stricter
  or more lenient in this area, or if you believe there are any outliers that we
  missed.</p>

  Hunger or Frozen Wastes, but we feel that he is currently too dependent on
  taking one of these talents, so we are reducing the opportunity cost for going

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Imperius is performing exactly where we would like
  him to, with a win rate of exactly 50.0% at high level play. While we love
  basking in this balance nirvana, Imperius does suffer from some pick rate
  issues, particularly in his earlier tiers. Rather than only nerfing the
  talents that are often picked, we are instead looking to buff up the
  alternatives in hope that they see more play.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We promised Tomo00 that we would do this in our last

  <p>Our reasoning behind this change is that we want to make Tormented Souls
  more interesting, but due to its ease of use and previous meta-defining power,
  we are hesitant to give mechanics like more Healing, Armor, or Life Steal that
  simply add power to the Heroic. Instead, we are giving Malthael the ability to
  create more options for himself by having more opportunities to move around
  the battlefield with Wraith Strike.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> An unintended side-effect of buffing the damage of
  Misha, Charge! to be much more meaningful was its interaction with Easy Prey.
  We intend Easy Prey to be the better talent when taking Mercenary Camps, while
  having a smaller effect of buffing Rexxar's general wave clear. When this
  talent also becomes the best Wave Clear option, it encroaches too much on Bird
  of Prey's design space, so we're removing that functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've gotten feedback from players that they missed
  the old Quick Mind talent that existed before Alarak's rework, as it allowed
  them to use Telekinesis in more creative ways since they felt more free to
  cast the ability when it was on a shorter cooldown. We agree, and we're using
  the Ruthless Momentum talent to allow this to happen. Instead of reducing all
  of Alarak's cooldowns, we're instead specializing the talent to greatly reduce
  the cooldown of Telekinesis. This should allow players who pick this talent to
  reposition themselves, peel for their allies, or fish for initiations on the
  enemy more often.</p>

  new playstyle). We're trying to give a small buff to her base kit, while also
  balancing out a few of the Talent tiers. In particular, we're changing
  Blessing of the Bronze to be an activated ability, so that opponents have

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Possession provides Sylvanas a significant swing in

  both of these in line, we're increasing its cooldown so that she has to think

event, bug fixes, and more! Read on for details.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>The cap on maximum negative Armor has been increased from -25 to -75, now that different Armor effects no longer stack. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The negative Armor cap was originally instituted as a
  safety precaution so that stacking long term negative Armor effects wouldn't
  lead to degenerate gameplay. We don't anticipate many effects to go beyond
  -25, but there are a few cases where this can happen (including the new
  Unraveling Talent on Chromie and Sgt. Hammer's Shrapnel Mines).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Hero Roles Update 
<ul>
<li><strong>Updated roles include:</strong> Tank, Bruiser, Support, Healer, Melee Assassin, and Ranged Assassin.</li>

<li><span class="text-warning">Shared A.I. behavior has been reverted in some cases and simplified in others.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-warning">Fixed multiple cases where A.I. controlled Heroes would not respond to player pings.</span></li>

<h3 id="new-event">New Event</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Caldeum Complex</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome to the Caldeum Acropolis, 2103 AD. A city bought and sold a hundred
times over, now giant Mega Corporations hold more sway in the ever-shifting
politics of the world than governments. Down on the rain slicked streets,
humans, mutants, machines and synthetics all struggle to find their place in
the light of the neon glow beneath the towering monuments to capitalism
lording over them.</p>

<p>With such oppression, the common people often turn to a life of crime. The
leader of one of the largest gangs, the Azure Dragons, goes by the nickname,
<strong>Chromie.</strong> Both a hacker and an anti-corporate street artist, many have said
her work has an almost prophetic quality, as if she sees through time itself.
The corporate media would have you believe she uses her gang of hackers to
illegally ensure her prophecies become true, but lately her work has turned
dark, as if she's seen a cataclysmic force on the horizon…</p>

<p>Recently, the Dragons have found an ally in the Onyx Turtles. While it's rare
to see the gangs working together, as the noose of systemic oppression has
grown tighter, those in the underbelly of the mega-city have had to find new
ways to survive. <strong>Kharazim</strong> and his Turtles are a harder sort of stock than
most, with many known gladiators and street fighters serving in the ranks.
This new alliance has provided the Azure Dragons a strong defense against
threats in the physical world.</p>

<p>High above, the Jigoku Cybernetics Corporation, a primary manufacturer of
mechanical augmentations, has become a target of both groups. In the mean
streets, human enhancement has become one of the few options left to move the
playing field more into the favor of those willing to bend the law. But their
efforts have not gone unnoticed, and any who would dare to impugn the honor of
Jigoku find themselves in the sights of the CyberOni, Jigoku's elite agents:
merciless killers at the beck and call of their bureaucratic masters.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Caldeum Complex Loot Chests</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Starting the week of March 26, all Loot chests earned through progression
(except Hero-specific Chests), Heroes Brawl, or by spending Gold will be
Caldeum Complex Loot Chests. These loot chests guarantee at least one item
from the Caldeum Complex or previous years' Lunar New Year Spring events.
Carve out your place among the infamous gangs and score yourself some sweet
loot before the streets calm on April 30!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will <strong>not</strong> become Caldeum Complex Loot Chests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lúcio's rework is unlocking some new ways to help
  your allies and further harass your enemies! His old Trait, Wall Ride, is
  still completely functional but has been moved to his Mount (Z). The
  replacement Trait, Push Off, is a new utility Ability that gives Lúcio more
  mobility with a built-in way to peel enemies for his allies. That is just the
  beginning, though, as Lúcio has also gained a new Heroic Ability—High Five.
  This Ability allows him a small bit of burst healing to help compete with
  Sound Barrier while also granting an on-demand Unstoppable buff to allies that
  may have bitten off more than they can chew. If you were a big fan of Reverse
  Amp, no need to worry, it stays on his kit in the form of a talent and has
  similar functionality! In response to the added power, we are slowing him down
  a little so he is not quite as frustrating to lock down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goal with this Chromie update is to create
  various degrees of success that Chromie can enjoy, so that she doesn't feel
  like quite the same all-or-nothing mage that she's historically been.
  Traditionally, Chromie has often required a hard counter to keep her in check
  or completely wrecked an opposing team, creating polarizing experiences. We're
  instituting a lot of changes that allow Chromie to get partial success with
  her Abilities (multiple Sand Blasts baseline, 3 blasts of Dragon's Breath),
  while also widening her toolkit (friendly Stasis, Basic Attack damage, PvE
  damage). While we're diversifying her kit, we also want to make sure that
  Chromie feels special, and we think that her Sand Echoes and predictive
  gameplay with Dragon's Breath are still unique parts of her that embody the
  feeling of artillery mage while still having moments of counter play for
  opponents.</p>

<ul>
<li>The cap on maximum negative Armor has been increased from -25 to -75, now that different Armor effects no longer stack 
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The negative Armor cap was originally instituted as a safety precaution so that stacking long term negative Armor effects wouldn't lead to degenerate gameplay. We don't anticipate many effects to go beyond -25, but there are a few cases where this can happen (including the new Unraveling Talent on Chromie and Sgt. Hammer's Shrapnel Mines).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hero Roles Update 
<ul>
<li>Updated roles include: Tank, Bruiser, Support, Healer, Melee Assassin, and Ranged Assassin</li>
<li>For more information, please review our blog <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/">here</a></li>

<h3 id="new-event-caldeum-complex">New Event: Caldeum Complex</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Caldeum Arcopolis, 2103 AD. A city bought and sold a hundred
times over, now giant Mega Corporations hold more sway in the ever-shifting
politics of the world than governments. Down on the rain slicked streets,
humans, mutants, machines and synthetics all struggle to find their place in
the light of the neon glow beneath the towering monuments to capitalism
lording over them.</p>

<p>With such oppression, the common people often turn to a life of crime. The
leader of one of the largest gangs, the Azure Dragons, goes by the nickname,
<strong>Chromie.</strong> Both a hacker and an anti-corporate street artist, many have said
her work has an almost prophetic quality, as if she sees through time itself.
The corporate media would have you believe she uses her gang of hackers to
illegally ensure her prophecies become true, but lately her work has turned
dark, as if she's seen a cataclysmic force on the horizon…</p>

<p>Recently, the Dragons have found an ally in the Onyx Turtles. While it's rare
to see the gangs working together, as the noose of systemic oppression has
grown tighter, those in the underbelly of the mega-city have had to find new
ways to survive. <strong>Kharazim</strong> and his Turtles are a harder sort of stock than
most, with many known gladiators and street fighters serving in the ranks.
This new alliance has provided the Azure dragons a strong defense against
threats in the physical world.</p>

<p>High above, the Jigoku Cybenetics Corporation, a primary manufacturer of
mechanical augmentations, has become a target of both groups. In the mean
streets, human enhancement has become one of the few options left to move the
playing field more into the favor of those willing to bend the law. But their
efforts have not gone unnoticed, and any who would dare to impugn the honor of
Jigoku find themselves in the sights of the CyberOni, Jigoku's elite agents:
merciless killers at the beck and call of their bureaucratic masters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lúcio's rework is unlocking some new ways to help your allies and further harass your enemies! His old Trait, Wall Ride, is still completely functional but has been moved to his Mount (Z). The replacement Trait, Push Off, is a new utility Ability that gives Lúcio more mobility with a built-in way to peel enemies for his allies.</p>
  
  <p>That is just the beginning, though, as Lúcio has also gained a new Heroic
  Ability—High Five. This Ability allows him a small bit of burst healing to
  help compete with Sound Barrier while also granting an on-demand Unstoppable
  buff to allies that may have bitten off more than they can chew. If you were a
  big fan of Reverse Amp, no need to worry, it stays on his kit in the form of a
  talent and has similar functionality! In response to the added power, we are
  slowing him down a little so he is not quite as frustrating to lock down.</p>

<h4 id="alarak">Alarak</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blade of the Highlord (Trait)
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes grant 2% Sadism, up to 30%. Sadism gained from Blade of the Highlord is lost on death</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since its inception, Blade of the Highlord has not
  performed well compared to the other talents on its tier. With this change,
  we're hoping to bring it to a more competitive space by making its bonuses
  more permanent instead of only lasting for a small window of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Keep Moving! (Z)
<ul>

</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Stun duration increased from .5 seconds to .75 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While looking at Cho, we saw an opportunity to make
  some of Gall's lesser picked talents more powerful or interesting so that they
  are more competitive against other options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="li-ming">Li-Ming</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aether Walker (E)
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Casting Teleport causes Li-Ming's next cast of Magic Missiles to deal 10% increased damage</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Triumvirate (W)
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 50% to 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zei's Vengeance (W)
<ul>
<li>Arcane Orb cooldown reduction reduced from 2 to 1 second
<ul>
<li>This should increase the total cooldown reduction of an Arcane Orb hitting with the Triumvirate proc from 5 seconds to 6 seconds when Triumvirate and Zei's Vengeance are both taken</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're going to get you to want to pick Aether Walker.
  Just you wait…</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="lunara">Lunara</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blossom Swell (Q)
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: 
<ul>
<li>Hitting an enemy Hero with Noxious Blossom increases Lunara's Movement Speed by 15% for 3 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Blossom Swell has been underperforming compared to
  other talents on its tier since Lunara's last rework. While her talent
  diversity is fairly good compared to other heroes in the game, we want to give
  her Q build some love, and saw this as an opportunity to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="orphea">Orphea</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mind Devourer (E)
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus reduced from 5 to 4 per stack</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Orphea has been performing very well as of late, with
  Mind Devourer in particular overshadowing other talents on its tier. We're
  slightly reducing its power to reduce her overall effectiveness while
  hopefully motivating players to try out her other Level 7 talents more often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="raynor">Raynor</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Raynor's Raider (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leash range increased from 12.5 to 14</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> There are many cases where due to the leash range of
  Raynor's Raider, it doesn't quite do what Raynor wants it to. To make it more
  consistently do what the player wants and expects, we're slightly increasing
  its leash range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="samuro">Samuro</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Way of the Blade (W)
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Now also reduces the Physical Armor of enemy Heroes hit by Critical Strike by 10 for 2 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Way of the Wind (E)
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality:
<ul>
<li>Samuro's Critical Strikes reduce the cooldown of Windwalk by 1.5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's not too surprising that Way of Illusion has
  dominated Samuro's Level 1 tier since it adds the most direct teamfight power
  due to buffing his Basic Attack damage. Rather than nerf it further, we're
  looking to instead buff up its competing options, which should also add some
  synergies to his later talent tiers, and hopefully create more diversity on
  other tiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tychus">Tychus</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bob and Weave (E)
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Now also grants Tychus 1.5 Basic Attack range</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To make Bob and Weave feel more fun and powerful,
  we're adding to the kiting theme of the talent by also providing Tychus with a
  Basic Attack range increase.</p>

<h4 id="azmodan">Azmodan</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Globe of Annihilation (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage scaling reduced from 3% to 2.5%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Greed (Q)
<ul>
<li>New functionality:
<ul>
<li>Globe of Annihilation deals 20% bonus damage to non-Heroic targets. Quest: After gaining 200 Annihilation, increase the range of All Shall Burn by 25%, and Demon Warriors gain 20% Movement Speed and Attack Speed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sin's Grasp (E)
<ul>
<li>New functionality:
<ul>
<li>All Shall Burn Slows enemies by 15% during its channel. If the channel finishes, increase this slow to 45% for 2 seconds, and reduce the cooldown of All Shall Burn by 50%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trample (Active)
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 60 to 20 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan is raining a bit too much destruction on the
  Nexus, so we're bringing his late-game power down a notch by reducing Globe of
  Annihilation's scaling damage. In addition, we saw an opportunity to help his
  talent pick rates by adjusting a couple existing talents, which will hopefully
  motivate more players to pursue builds that don't involve powering up Globe of
  Annihilation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="medivh">Medivh</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Temporal Flux (Q)
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction changed from 1 second per Basic Attack and 3 seconds for Arcane Rift hits to 3% per Basic Attack and 9% per Arcane Rift hit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We like talents that lower Heroic cooldowns, but
  unfortunately many of the heroes who have these talents also have Heroics with
  wildly different cooldowns, which makes these talents hard to tune and pick in
  many cases. Because of this, we're standardizing these talents to reduce a
  percentage of each Heroic's cooldown so that players feel free to pick the
  talent regardless of which Heroic they chose earlier in the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="probius">Probius</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Null Gate (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Range increased from 8.5 to 9.5</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Null Gate is performing well in regards to win-
  rate compared to Pylon Overcharge, the Heroic is still not picked as much as
  we would like, and is much harder to use properly. Because of this, we're
  buffing its range to make it a little more usable, so that Probius players can
  more consistently get value out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="zagara">Zagara</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Baneling Massacre (Q)
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Increase the damage of Banelings by 20%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Viscous Acid (Q)
<ul>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds</li>
<li>Slow amount increased from 20% to 25%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bile Drop (E)
<ul>
<li>Quest completion requirement reduced from 15 to 12</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Zagara's Level 7 talents have traditionally been very
  weak, and these changes are meant to make the tier feel more fun overall. If
  they blow her win-rate out of the water, we'll look at base kit nerfs to
  compensate.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slumber Shells (E)
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>Hitting an enemy Hero with Sleep dart grants Ana 25% Movement Speed for 3 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Debilitating Dart (Active)
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Night Terrors (E)
<ul>
<li>Cooldown of Sleep Dart when a Hero is not woken up early changed from 6 seconds to 5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're buffing up some of Ana's underperforming talents
  to make them more competitive with their counterparts. In addition, since we
  greatly increased its reliability, we're slightly increasing the cooldown of
  Eye of Horus to get ahead of potential frustration issues with a globally
  damaging Heroic being on such a low cooldown.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For how easy Li Li is to play, she is simply too
  powerful and popular, particularly at the lower and mid-levels of play. These
  changes are meant to reduce her dominance at those levels, which should free
  up more options for players wanting to pick other healers that they would like
  to master.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've begun to take a look at some of Whitemane's
  underlying issues with Mana management, particularly in regards to how her
  talents interact with her base mechanics. We don't know how long this will
  take, and wanted to push out some small buffs to her to help her play and win
  rate in the meantime. When looking at her kit, we noticed that she had an
  abnormally high Basic Attack speed, combined with very low damage. We're
  reducing her Attack Speed, as she is not the kind of character that can turret
  on enemy Heroes like Tychus can, and we're buffing her damage to be much
  greater so that those attacks more meaningfully interact with Zeal. We're
  hoping that these small buffs better reward aggressive Whitemane players with
  both increased damage and healing output.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since our last round of nerfs, Cho'gall has fallen off
  a little more than we would like. In Cho's particular case, we feel that his
  survivability takes a particularly hard hit once the enemy team has access to
  Heroic abilities which are reliably able to shut him down. To help with this,
  we're moving his defensive talent tier from Level 16 to 13 in order to shorten
  the window of time that the enemy team has to take advantage of this
  particular weakness.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo, while not winning outside of our normally
  acceptable bounds, is banned a disproportionate amount compared to other
  heroes in the game. We're slightly reducing how available his combo is so that
  enemy players have a larger window of time to take advantage of his
  threatening abilities being on cooldown.</p>

<li>Moved from Level 13</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since his rework, Ominous Wraith at Level 13 has
  largely defined Leoric's place on a team at more competitive levels of play.
  Rather than nerf something that we consider to be a fairly cool and unique
  playstyle, we're instead looking to buff up the other ways that players can
  build Leoric. Now all of his key build-around talents will be at Level 13,
  which should make his Basic Attack playstyle come online much sooner, and give
  him more options if he wants to build into Drain Hope, as he can now combine
  Unyielding Despair with Hardened Bones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Like Diablo, Mal'Ganis has a huge ban rate, and

  mindful of how much they can get away with when diving into the enemy team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since his inception, Rexxar has been one of the
  highest win-rate heroes in our game, never going below 50% at high levels of
  play. Despite this, we've heard consistent feedback that he doesn't feel as
  impactful as players would like. While we love that Rexxar depends heavily on
  his relationship with Misha to be effective, it also limits what we can do
  with him to make him feel powerful and fun to play. To help in this regard,
  we're moving a lot of his power out of the more automatic things that Misha
  does (mostly Basic attacking enemies), and into things that Rexxar himself is
  actively doing, such as using his Basic Attacks and commanding Misha to Stun
  enemies. Since we're buffing Misha, Charge so much, we're nerfing some of its
  associated talents as they are already highly picked by Rexxar players, and
  this change would otherwise be a dramatic buff to them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's hard to create a competing talent to Nerves of
  Steel due to the incredible on-demand survivability that it gives her in a
  team fight. To help its viability, we're adding survivability to Giant Slammer
  in hopes that it competes more directly with Nerves of Steel while being
  unique in that it also gives Sonya more damage in a teamfight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Abathur has had a unique place in
  Heroes, being a powerful force at high level play while having a relatively
  low win-rate across the board. These changes are meant to spruce up his
  talents while streamlining his gameplay and introducing more counter-play to
  the hero. Carapace, particularly with the Sustained Carapace talent, created
  some awkward gameplay where it was much more efficient to use Symbiote on
  cooldown, even when the desire was to stay on one target, due to the cooldown
  refresh that it gave Carapace. In order to clean this up, Sustained Carapace
  is baseline and the cooldown of Carapace has been reduced, so Abathur no
  longer has to continuously remove Carapace to be efficient. In addition,
  Abathur's Locusts are now more potent, but they last for a shorter duration,
  meaning Abathur players will be more rewarded for positioning themselves
  aggressively and punished when they overextend too much.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Ana came to the Nexus during the ‘Quest Revolution'
  where we were adding them in as many places as we could. We have learned a lot
  since that time, so we spent some time re-designing and re-organizing Ana's
  talent tree. Bringing Aim Down Sights into her base Shrike functionality gives
  us a design solve for the powerful yet flawed Piercing Darts quest. The rest
  of the talent changes and shuffles were directed at opening up some new builds
  while keeping all of her current beloved capabilities!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Abathur has had a unique place in
  Heroes, being a powerful force at high level play while having a relatively
  low win-rate across the board. These changes are meant to spruce up his
  talents while streamlining his gameplay and introducing more counter-play to
  the hero. Carapace, particularly with the Sustained Carapace talent, created
  some awkward gameplay where it was much more efficient to use Symbiote on
  cooldown, even when the desire was to stay on one target, due to the cooldown
  refresh that it gave Carapace. In order to clean this up, Sustained Carapace
  is baseline and the cooldown of Carapace has been reduced, so Abathur no
  longer has to continuously remove Carapace to be efficient. In addition,
  Abathur's Locusts are now more potent, but they last for a shorter duration,
  meaning Abathur players will be more rewarded for positioning themselves
  aggressively and punished when they overextend too much.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Ana came to the Nexus during the ‘Quest Revolution'
  where we were adding them in as many places as we could. We have learned a lot
  since that time, so we spent some time re-designing and re-organizing Ana's
  talent tree. Bringing Aim Down Sights into her base Shrike functionality gives
  us a design solve for the powerful yet flawed Piercing Darts quest. The rest
  of the talent changes and shuffles were directed at opening up some new builds
  while keeping all of her current beloved capabilities!</p>

</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak's Beetle Build has been a difficult sell,
  particularly at level 1, due to the power discrepancy of Resilient Scarabs
  compared to other talents on the tier. In order to help the build, we're
  reducing the opportunity cost of picking its talents by removing Resilient
  Scarabs and baking its functionality into Legion of Beetles. This should make
  for a much more attractive talent at level 1 against his other options, and
  should open up other build paths for players who like to slay their enemies
  with many tiny little friends. Anub'arak is a bit too strong overall right
  now, so we're reducing his damage so that he's not quite so dominant compared
  to the other tanks in our game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're pushing Chen towards more of a Bruiser role with
  these changes. One of the longstanding issues with Chen is that due to his
  trait functionality and tuning, he can either be shut down fairly easily or be
  too powerful depending on if the enemy team has the necessary CC and burst
  damage to deal with him. We're beginning to experiment with smoothing this out
  a but by increasing his sustained survivability and reducing the amount of
  burst he can tackle while also increasing his damage. While we are still
  iterating on him, we wanted to get some preliminary changes out sooner rather
  than hold back until we are finished.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> There was a large disparity of the value that Uther
  could receive when taking Armor of Faith against various heroes who have small
  stuns that proc often against enemies (such as Johanna.) While we still like
  the idea of this talent turning crowd control against Uther into a boon for
  him, we want to be able to control its frequency so that his output isn't
  drastically different when facing off against certain heroes. To compensate
  for the loss of uptime in these situations, we are giving him a fairly
  significant Mana return, which should offset the cooldown reduction that he
  receives on Holy Light when this talent activates.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Overall, Stitches is faring well with his new toys.
  There are a few places we think could stand some numerical changes, but we'd
  like to give him a bit more time to settle in with all the other changes that
  went out with this patch. We will continue to monitor the large lad, but felt
  there were some easy wins on talents that were obviously underperforming.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <span class="text-warning">While not a bug, the interaction between Orphea's
  Eternal Feast and the Triglav Protector was too strong and could negate an
  entire objective without any opportunities for counter-play attached to it.
  This also highlighted an inconsistency with the battleground where a team
  could spend all their resources winning the objective but find themselves
  unable to actually use it under certain circumstances so with this change,
  we've addressed both issues.</span></p>

<p><strong>Catapults</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When a team destroys a Fort, they'll now gain a Catapult in every 3rd Minion wave.
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to keep early-game Catapults from being too devastating to defending teams, Catapult attack splash size, attack range, and damage/health will gradually increase as the game progresses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Changes</strong></p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <span class="text-warning">Thank you so much for all of the feedback regarding
  the 2019 Gameplay Updates. While there is still a lot of community speculation
  about the outcome of these changes, there has been a resounding amount of
  concern about the loss of Fort and Keep XP. We agree that the complete loss of
  XP from Forts and Keeps may reduce the incentive to kill them to unhealthy
  levels, especially at higher levels of play. In response, we have reintroduced
  XP to the structures in a way that will reward players for taking them early
  while granting a gradual increase in power instead of large bursts. This
  should reinforce our goal of making matches closer while also rewarding teams
  for destroying enemy structures as quick as possible.</span></p>
  
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> After listening to feedback, we have decided to pull
  back the laning Mercenary change outlined in our 2019 gameplay updates in
  order to give winning teams more opportunities to pull ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Boss Camps, Sentinel Camps (Hanamura Temple), and Support Camps (Volskaya Foundry) will now be flagged as Elite. 
<ul>
<li>Elite Mercenary Camps are Unstoppable &amp; Unbribable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unit Radii</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The unit radius values for most Heroes has been reduced by 5-15%</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <span class="text-warning">In an effort to improve visual clarity when many
  heroes are on-screen, we've updated the art for the Hero Ring displayed
  underneath heroes. To reinforce this effort, we've also done a pass on the
  Unit Radii for all heroes. We understand that these radius adjustments will
  have a minor but intended impact on landing and dodging abilities, and as a
  result, felt that the 2019 Gameplay Updates were the best time to make these
  changes.</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <span class="text-warning">Hail your Warchief! We hope you enjoy our changes to
  Sylvanas as much as we have. Sylvanas now boasts impressive skirmishing power
  while retaining her unique ability to shut down enemy fortifications. In
  exchange for this power, she now has a fair amount of counter-play with her
  abilities, which should make her interactions with other heroes more
  interesting. We're also experimenting with putting a uniquely large portion of
  her power into talents, which we would love to hear your feedback on once you
  get a chance to try her out!</span></p>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack range reduced from 5.5 to 4.5</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Genji continues to be an incredibly powerful force at
  the highest level of play. This change will force Genji players to put
  themselves at more risk when attacking enemy Heroes before they're in his
  Swift Strike's execute range. If this change is not enough, we have some
  additional ideas to curb Genji's dominance that we will explore in the future.</p>

<li>Giant Slayer (Passive)
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 1.5% to 2% of an enemy Hero's maximum Health</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We think that Hanzo is able to burst down bosses and
  map events too quickly, so we're removing the synergy between Never Outmatched
  and Serrated Arrows. We're making a few other tuning adjustments to make other
  Talents more attractive picks, as well as compensating some of the lost PvE
  power with some more PvP power.</p>

<li>Now grants an additional stack of Snipe for hitting enemy Heroes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are switching some of the bonuses from Perfect Shot
  and Psionic Efficiency to better align their rewards and to make the Snipe
  build friendlier to players earlier on in the game. Most notably, players who
  pick Perfect Shot will no longer have to worry about running out of Mana
  quickly due to landing multiple Snipes in a teamfight.</p>

<li>Lurking Terror (W/E)
<ul>
<li>Now shares a cooldown with Chomp (W)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The first Nexus-born Hero has arrived and is showing a
  bit of teeth, especially in the burst department. The combination of a high-
  stacked Ravenous Hunger combined with double-Chomps with Lurking Terror was a
  bit over-the-top, especially since she could set everything up fairly safely
  with Crushing Jaws. We have taken the bite out of that combo by linking the
  cooldowns of Chomp and Lurking Terror. We are offsetting this loss of burst by
  increasing her sustained damage potential and will continue to closely
  monitor. We realize that the loss of her blow-up potential will make Lurking
  Terror a much less exciting talent to pick and have future design ideas on how
  to spruce it up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Regenerative Microbes is dominating Abathur's Level 1
  talent tier, as well as causing issues at the pro level of play. We are taking
  a look at Abathur to see what improvements can be made, but wanted to get this
  change out sooner rather than later while we iterate on him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We agree with the feedback that games play out better
  when there are windows of time to take advantage of enemy cooldowns,
  particularly when it relates to Supports. This change is intended to reduce
  Deckard's ability to keep himself or his allies alive when multiple enemies
  dive onto them. Going forward, we will be looking at ways to increase counter-
  play by adding these windows of time for players to take advantage of each
  other's cooldowns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Stukov's changes a few months ago were intended to
  create new build paths while also reducing the dominance of his Lurking Arm
  build. While this had the effect we intended, Lurking Arm is now a much more
  risky ability to use for the majority of the game, whether or not he takes
  talents related to improving the ability. This change is intended to round
  this out a bit by letting Stukov use Lurking Arm a little more safely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The healing rework to Tyrande has made her a
  formidable force as of late and with this round of changes we think she will
  sit in a great spot. The swap of her level 1 and 7 talent tiers should open
  some new early-game decision-making while pushing back her cleanse mechanic a
  bit further into the game. We are still evaluating Celestial Attunement on the
  design side and may make larger changes at a later date.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are intended to better round out Blaze's
  Level 4 talents, as well as to address the disparity in his power between
  casual and pro play. Bunker Drop in particular has been used to great
  effectiveness at higher level play to avoid nearly all damage from enemy teams
  with little risk due to the ability to instantly get in and out of the Bunker.
  While players will still be able to avoid large amounts of burst damage with
  the Heroic, they will no longer be able to easily go in and out of the Bunker
  without putting themselves at risk.</p>
