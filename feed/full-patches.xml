<h4 id="arthas">Arthas</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2782 to 2860.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration increased from 5.80 to 5.96.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rune Tap [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from 4% to 5% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Army of the Dead [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tooltip now states how much damage Ghouls do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legion of Northrend [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase Ghoul Basic Attack damage by 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Absolute Zero [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Root duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
<li>Slow duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Death's Advance [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Active Movement Speed bonus duration increased from 3 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-Magic Shell [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Arthas is slightly underperforming compared to other
  Warriors, so we're giving him a small baseline Health buff which we feel is
  appropriate since he doesn't have the mobility that a lot of other Warriors
  bring to the table. We've also taken a look at his Level 20 talents and beefed
  them up all be much more epic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Devastating Charge [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage when hitting enemies into terrain increased from 120 to 130.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diabolical Momentum [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.25 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since we changed Devastating Charge Diablo has fallen
  off a bit. While we believe he's in a more healthy spot overall, we understand
  how players miss the unique role he had as a tank who had the ability to burst
  down enemies who are out of position. We're giving a little bit of that back
  in the form of a baseline buff to Shadow charge so that he can have some of
  that fantasy back no matter how players choose to build him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tyrael">Tyrael</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense of the Angels [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 120 to 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now the Defense of the Angels no longer has a
  cooldown reduction component, we're reducing its cooldown to be more in line
  with similar effects.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<li>Damage bonus increased from 100% to 125%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Battle Hunger [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing bonus increased from 60% to 70%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Press Forward [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Imperius is being healed by a Regeneration Globe, he gains 10 Armor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blaze of Glory [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 125 to 135.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pathetic Mortals [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduction increased from 40% to 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unrelenting Descent [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 5 to 10 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brand of Solarion [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Imperius a slew of buffs to
  underperforming talents, which we believe will push him into being a more
  stable pick on most maps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="rexxar">Rexxar</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage increased from 125 to 134.</li>
<li>Misha Health reduced from 1620 to 1520.</li>
<li>Misha Health Regeneration reduced from 3.38 to 3.17.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mend Pet [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mana cost increased from 60 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rexxar's ability to win the laning phase on point
  control maps is a little too powerful, so we're nerfing his ability to keep
  Misha alive. To compensate him for this nerf, we're increasing his Basic
  Attack damage, which will both help him in latter parts of the game and make
  the early game more about how well he can work with Misha to outtrade the
  enemy Hero. We're hoping that this leads to more interaction in the laning
  phase, with fewer instances of Misha being able to stand on a point for
  prolonged periods of time while the opposing hero is unable to push her off.
  We know there is a fine line between keeping his unique role on these maps and
  feeling too oppressed when playing against him, so we'll be keeping an eye on
  these changes and will tune as necessary going forward.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>New Talent: Decrepify [Q]</strong>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kalan's Edict [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Each time Skeletal Warriors deal damage, reduce the cooldown of Bone Armor and Xul's Heroic Ability by 1.5%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Xul's rework has arrived! Our goal with these changes
  is primarily to make him feel more like a Diablo Necromancer, and to make his
  Skeletons a larger part of his kit outside of their pushing potential. Xul now
  has the ability to spawn Skeletal Warriors in combat via Spectral Scythe, and
  they now explode for damage when they die, giving enemy Heroes a reason to
  stay away from them while they mow them down. We also updated Xul's talents to
  embrace this fantasy, with many options to use Skeletons as a mechanism to
  deliver various buffs to Xul and debuffs to the enemy team. We had a blast
  testing him, and hope you enjoy him as much as we have!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While decently popular, from a win rate perspective
  Anduin has been underperforming compared to other Healers, so we're giving him
  some buffs largely to underperforming talents to help him out.</p>

  increasing its Healing when he does get a successful proc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Gladiator's War Shout a fairly
  substantial buff to make it more powerful and interesting, and as a result
  also buffing Bloodlust. We're hoping this opens up an alternative playstyle
  for Rehgar that can compete better with Ancestral Healing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback from Kerrigan players for some
  time that they would like to have the ability to cancel Chrysalis early. We
  originally intended it to be this way to separate it a bit from other similar
  mechanics and to give opponents a reliable way to counter it, but found that
  it ended up being less fun and interesting overall. Because of this, we're
  adding the ability for Kerrigan to cancel the effect early.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making this change to reduce the amount of time
  that The Butcher has to commit to a charge before he can cancel it. Currently
  there is an awkward time where he charges and may want to cancel it as soon as
  possible, but he is forced to move a fair amount forward before he can cancel
  his charge. To make this feel more responsive, we're reducing this window of

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our thinking with our Raynor changes in our previous
  patch was to solve a design problem with Ace in the Hole's mandatory synergy
  with Unstable Compound, while simultaneously giving him a bit of a buff
  overall by making his other two talents measure up to its new power. While
  this was largely successful, we underestimated how much more powerful Ace in
  the Hole would become compared to the new, buffed alternatives. We're lowering
  its damage a bit to compensate for the Slow that it gained, which should make
  the tier more even overall.</p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: While under 60% maximum Health, Cho receives 15% additional Movement Speed and healing received.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Each time Cho deals damage to enemy Heroes, he is healed for 60 over 3 seconds. Enemy Heroes hit by Gall's Dread Orb receive 35% less healing for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In regards to his trait, we want optimal play for
  Cho'gall to be to have Gall's Ogre Rage be active most of the time, with
  emergency switches to Cho's Ogre Hide when he is in danger. There are a few
  talents on Cho'galls tree that disincentivize this behavior, which we are
  adjusting now. Calloused Hide in particular was becoming an issue, as players
  have recently been finding it optimal to stay in Ogre Hide for the entire
  game, which removes the gameplay around the trait.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="malganis">Mal'Ganis</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2600 to 2500.</li>

<li>Cooldown increased from 80 to 100 seconds.</li>
<li>Damage reduced from 63 to 60.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mal'Ganis have been slightly too powerful for some
  time, so we're toning him down a bit.</p>

<h4 id="muradin">Muradin</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dwarf Toss [E]</strong>
<ul>

<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New talent: Dwarf Block [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Casting Dwarf Toss grants Muradin 4 charges of 75 Physical Armor against the next enemy Hero Basic Attack. These charges last for 10 seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Impact [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.25 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we've looked at Muradin.
  He's been such a staple in the meta for so long that we did not feel he needed
  any large changes. While minor, these buffs should help bring him back into
  the spotlight as a valuable member of any team.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Moved from Level 16.</li>
<li>No longer has a 4 second restriction after hitting enemy Heroes with Hook for its proc to reapply via Basic Attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pulverize [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 16.</li>
<li>Slow amount increased from 75% to 80%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lacerate [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Digestive Juices [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gas Flare [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Stitches some love by slightly
  increasing his crowd control capabilities and moving his Level 16 talents to
  come online earlier in the game. Since they add a lot of power to his ability
  to function as a powerful front line Warrior for his team, this should help
  him make plays for a greater portion of the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tyrael">Tyrael</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Archangel's Wrath [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Each enemy Hero hit reduces Tyrael's death timer by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ardent Restoration [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from 3.5 to 4 per stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyrael's Level 20 talents have been reordered to follow normal conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Defense of the Angels [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Activate to gain 50 Armor for 3 seconds. Each time Tyrael damages an enemy Hero with a Basic Attack or Basic Ability, increase the duration of this Armor bonus by .5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It has been a longstanding request to make Tyrael's
  trait have some more oomph to it, so we're giving him a thematic change where
  he can reduce his death timer when hitting enemy Heroes. We don't expect this
  to be a huge winrate bump, but we do think it makes it feel a bit better to
  play as the Archangel of Justice.</p>

<h4 id="deathwing">Deathwing</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<li><strong>Incinerate [W]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduced from 3% to 2.5% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathwing continues to be a force to be reckoned
  with, so we're continuing to adjust his power level down. Rather than doing
  one fairly large set of Health, damage, and talent nerfs which can easily go
  overboard, we're taking a more incremental approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="malthael">Malthael</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throwing Shade [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer has a quest component.</li>
<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 4 to 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost of Death Shroud after taking talent increased from 25 to 30.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tormented Souls [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 80 to 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Last Rites [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 65 to 70 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Throwing Shade has not really worked out as an
  interesting Quest talent, as Malthael is often in a solo lane with only one
  opponent. Rather than gate the benefit behind what is often an arbitrary time
  gate, we're going to give him its benefits immediately.</p>

<li><strong>Level 4</strong>

<li><strong>Prolific Dispersal [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer increases the range of Toxic Nest.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the duration of Toxic Nest by 45 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To curb some of the frustrating gameplay where
  Abathur can continuously backdoor enemy Keeps, we're reducing some of the
  buffs we gave to Locust Strain, as well as changing the functionality of
  Prolific Dispersal. While Abathur players can still do this strategy, it will
  be more difficult to pull off, as Abathur will have to travel to a more
  central location on the map to plant a Toxic Nest for vision to burrow into
  the enemy base.</p>

<ul>
<li>No longer increases the radius of Expulsion Zone.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Expulsion Zone by 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we made some serious
  changes to Zarya's talents, so these changes should shake things up a bit for
  her. Plasma Shock in particular was not seeing much play, so we're rolling its
  functionality into Pinpoint Accuracy, and buffing other talents on the tier to
  keep their competitiveness. We're also redesigning Clear Out to give a massive
  cooldown reduction to Expulsion Zone instead of a radius increase, as we found
  the radius increase to not be the most impactful or fun Level 20 upgrade.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While our recent changes to Resurrect have put Auriel
  in the spotlight, she has been performing a bit too well compared to other
  Healers for some time now. We're reducing some of her power to keep her more
  in line with her peers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While reasonably powerful, Rejuvenation didn't give
  much feedback to the player in regards to the benefit that it provided. We're
  changing the talent to have a little more visual clarity and gameplay compared
  to before, which should help improve its performance.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These are minor tuning changes intended to help
  Jaina's build diversity. Ice Floes in particular is in a potentially powerful
  spot in the right situations, as when combined with Icy Veins and Northern
  Exposure or Numbing Blast, can do a lot of AoE damage to the enemy team in a
  short amount of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Similar to Orphea last patch, we're removing a use
  case where it often felt like a requirement to take two talents together for
  their full effect. Ace in the Hole will now give Raynor the Slow that he
  desperately wants for its proc, and to make sure that his other Level 1
  talents are competitive, we're giving them a boost as well.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We like how the new Barricade is playing, but since
  Sgt. Hammer's Mana tension is now fairly high, taking the talent often meant
  that she would very quickly run out of Mana. We're giving it a hefty Mana cost
  reduction, which should make it an even more attractive pick.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In addition to buffing underperforming talents, we're

  good Abathur players who pay close attention to their position on the map and
  the state of the game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We knew Auriel's Resurrect changes were going to be a
  big deal, and for the most part they have been going fairly well. It's now
  picked much more often, and, to our pleasant surprise, isn't winning by a
  large margin over Crystal Aegis. While we like the epic moment of power that
  the current iteration offers, there is understandably a bit of frustration
  with Heroic now. To add some more counter-play, we're reducing its cast range
  and adding more to its cast time to give opponents a better chance to
  interrupt her. Auriel players will now have to choose their moments much more
  wisely if they hope to get a Resurrect off on a key ally who recently died.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Bio-Explosion Switch has always been in a bit of an
  awkward spot due to the opportunity cost of ending Lurking Arm early. To make
  the talent more obviously powerful, we're adding some significant damage to
  the explosion and a larger Silence duration to the detonation to make up for
  the fact that Stukov's Lurking Arm goes away when the explosion happens. Now,
  if Stukov players properly detonate the Lurking Arm right as their enemies are
  leaving it, they should have a significant benefit when taking this talent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Maiev is a terror in the hands of the more
  elite portion of our playerbase, we don't want that to be a reason to not
  improve talents that we feel could use the help. Cruel Chain and Vengeful
  Knives have parts of their functionality that didn't feel particularly
  impactful, so we're adding more clear and useful benefits to each of them,

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Samuro's rework, statistically, has gone very well.
  His pick and win rates across his talents are in a better spot, and we believe
  his frustration levels have decreased since the changes. We're being tame with
  our initial changes due to some bug fixes that can change how some talents pan
  out over the long haul. While we wait, we wanted to buff a couple
  underperforming talents that shouldn't be affected by these fixes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying to solve a few issues with Orphea's
  current talent tree. Firstly, we're getting rid of the necessary synergy
  between Ancestral Strength and Fright, opting to instead bake a more reliable
  way to Slow enemies into Ancestral Strength. We're also buffing Growing
  Nightmare so that it's the premier E talent in an E build, as well as giving
  Lurking Terror some love. Ideally, Lurking Terror can now be used as a more
  unique way to set up Q and W hits on enemies who are far away from Orphea,
  particularly when combined with Insatiable for quick double W combos.</p>

<h4 id="probius">Probius</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Particle Accelerator [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maximum bonus damage for enemies hit reduced from 50% to 40%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Disruption Pulse by .5 seconds, plus an additional .5 seconds whenever Warp Rift explodes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tower Defense [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Photon Cannon by 4 seconds whenever Probius damages an enemy Hero with Disruption Pulse or Warp Rift.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repulsor [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interference [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemies that are hit by Warp Rift's explosion are knocked away from its center.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We haven't done many functionality changes to
  Probius's talents since his release, so we're now taking a look at places that
  could use some design love. We're targeting Tower Defense and Particle
  Accelerator as talents that should feel more prominent in their respective
  builds, as well as removing Repulsor and baking its functionality into
  Interference, as it wasn't enough of a stand-alone talent to be worth picking
  the majority of the time.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Both Barricade and Pulse Detonation Core have very
  low pick rates, so we're giving them some love, which should hopefully
  incentivize players to try them out more often.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to the week of March 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be New Toy Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from New Toy Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gaining Unstoppable now prevents and removes Blinds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've read recent feedback that it is strange that
  Silences are removed by the Unstoppable behavior, but Blinds are not. While
  Unstoppable has traditionally been primarily intended to remove effects that
  cause a hero to not be able to control the movement of their character, this
  philosophy gets a little grey when it comes to Silences, as heroes can still
  freely move, but they lose their ability to use movement abilities. In the
  past we decided that it was better for Silences to be removed, but understand
  the argument that Blinds are effectively Silences for auto-attack based
  heroes. We're trying this change to see how it pans out, as Blinds have
  traditionally been very powerful forms of soft CC in our game and this can
  help out heroes that are heavily shut down by them.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experience Globes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes who kill Minions with Abilities or Basic Attacks will automatically collect the experience from the Minions.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will no longer time out while travelling to a hero.</li>
<li>They will still expire if the hero moves out of range of the Experience Globe before it reaches them.</li>
<li>Removed a .5 second delay before Experience Globes can be collected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we're excited for the experience globes and the
  increased clarity that they offer in regards to how experience is gained,
  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locust Swarm [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 62 to 68.</li>
<li>Healing increased from 21 to 24.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debilitation [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spellpower reduction duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beetle, Juiced [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Health of Beetles by 20%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These buffs are to some of Anub'arak's talents that
  have been lagging behind their competitors for some time. Beetle, Juiced in
  particular should now be more consistent in its benefit to round out a Beetle-
  oriented build, even if Anub'arak isn't able to get a lot of Basic Attacks off
  on enemy Heroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surging Fist [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Channel time to charge maximum distance reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Ogre Hide is active, Cho gains 15% Movement Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Gall's Ogre Rage is active, enemy Heroes who are hit by Gall's Dread Orb have their Healing reduced by 35% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Veil [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor bonus increased from 100% to 200%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since our Old God worshipping Ogre
  has had some love, so we're both buffing up some of Cho's weaker talents as
  well as reducing the time that Surging Fist needs to be channeled in order to
  get a significant charge. This should help make Cho's Q build more viable as
  well as allow him to better reposition himself during teamfights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Condemn [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 58 to 55.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Johanna's become a dominant force in the tanking
  world, and is currently the #1 most picked hero at high level play. Because of
  this, we're slightly reducing her Health, as well as reverting her previous
  Condemn buff.</p>

<li><strong>Cataslysm [R]</strong>

<li>Periodic damage reduced from 12 to 11.</li>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draconic Might [Trait]</strong>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>

<li>Healing reduced from 5% to 3% maximum Health.</li>

<li><strong>Elementium Plating [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield amount reduced from 35% to 30% missing Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It turns out that Deathwing has lived up to his name,
  and has been destroying the Nexus since his release. Cataclysm and Burn
  Beneath My Shadow in particular have proven to be incredibly powerful, so
  we're reducing their effectiveness by a fairly significant amount. In addition
  to these changes, we're reducing the power of some overperforming talents as
  well as slightly nerfing his Destroyer form. Even with these changes, we
  expect Deathwing to continue to be a powerful addition to any team that he's
  on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="thrall">Thrall</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling Thunder [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: [Passive] Increase the number of Chain Lightning bounces by 1. For 8 seconds after hitting an enemy with Chain Lightning, Thrall's next Basic Attack against them grants him a stack of Frostwolf Resilience. If the target is an enemy Hero, then he also deals damage to them equal to 2% of their maximum Health and healing for the same amount.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Echo of the Elements and Crash Lightning are both
  fairly solid talents that have different use cases for when to pick them.
  Rolling Thunder has been less successful, so we're trying something new with
  the talent. We're still keeping its theme of marking targets with Chain
  Lightning and then hitting them for a bonus, but now this bonus will allow
  Thrall to deal bonus damage to enemy Heroes while also interacting with
  Frostwolf Resilience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="varian">Varian</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frenzy [R3]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer increases Varian's Attack Speed by 15%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Heroic Strike by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't super happy with the power of Frenzy's
  buff, as well as that it asked Varian players to learn a new Basic Attack
  cadence after being used to one speed the whole game. Instead, we're turning
  the Attack Speed bonus into a bonus to his damage over time by buffing Heroic
  Strike instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="yrel">Yrel</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dauntless [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical Armor duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Avenger [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Avenging Wrath at maximum charge also increases its damage by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templar's Verdict [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 6% to 7% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Favor [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holy Wrath [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus splash damage increased from 20% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word of Glory [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the amount that Yrel heals from damage received from 50% to 75%.</li>
<li>Range of allied healing increased from 8 to 12.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are mostly looking to buff Yrel's late-
  game by adding more power to her Level 16 talents. We want her to be more
  relevant without dominating the solo lane too much, so we're opting to make
  her Level 16 tier to be an exciting spike for her to hit in her games.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Auriel can now see her own ghost. If she presses R while dead, she will cast Resurrect on herself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying some fairly significant buffs to
  Resurrect in order to help it better compete with Crystal Aegis. Auriel can
  now Resurrect herself, which should help if she is the focus of the enemy
  team, and her targets will now come back faster and with all of their Health.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<li><strong>Greater Polymorph [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Polymorph's range by 30%. If Brightwing hits an enemy Hero with Arcane Flare's center within 2 seconds of being Polymorphed, then reduce Polymorph's cooldown by 7 seconds and gain 50 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last changes to Brightwing have better rounded
  out her talents, however Greater Polymorph was a little too hard to
  consistently proc. Instead of requiring her to hit a Polymorphed target, she
  now has a slightly larger window of time to get the cooldown reduction proc.
  We're also increasing the cooldown reduction bonus from 6 to 7 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Uther is in a bit of a strange spot at the moment, as
  he has recently had a spike in his win rate, and at higher level play we've
  been seeing him flexed into the main tank role. We think it's pretty cool that
  heroes can sometimes splash into other roles, but in general Uther is
  overperforming, so we're lowering his Health a bit. On an unrelated note,
  similar to Greymane, Uther's Level 20 talents have long been dominated by one
  choice, in this case Redemption. We're giving the other talents on the tier
  some significant buffs so that they can better compete. We hope that this
  won't increase his win rate significantly as Redemption has always been a
  fairly powerful talent, and are prepared to make adjustments if this ends up
  not being the case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are intended to limit Samuro's split-
  pushing capabilities, particularly with Illusion Master, as well as increase
  his presence in teamfights. A good Samuro player can be a bit of a pain to
  deal with, particularly when he's spending most of his time macroing and not
  engaging with the enemy team except to swap to a far away clone. These changes
  should make this scenario happen less often, while also giving Samuro more
  rewarding tools for engaging and fighting the enemy team.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Razor Swipe by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For Greymane, we're giving part of Incendiary
  Elixir's cooldown reduction bonus baseline so that the talent gives him some
  baseline power, as well as making it easier for him to complete the quest. In
  addition to this change, we're addressing his Level 20 talent diversity, which
  has not been the best. We're giving 3 of his talents significant buffs so that
  they can compete with Hunter's Blunderbuss, which has traditionally been the
  go-to option. Unleashed now makes it easier to proc Go for the Throat, as well
  as causing those procs to give him significantly more mobility and damage due
  to resetting his cooldowns. For Gilnean Roulette, we're trying the idea of the
  talent changing Cursed Bullet to be more like a 4th Basic Ability that can be
  used multiple times in a teamfight or as a potent poke tool. Finally, Tooth
  and Claw is now also turning Razor Swipe into a significant source of damage.</p>

<p>The next Heroes of the Storm patch has arrived! The update brings a new Hero,
Deathwing the Destroyer, new Experience Globes, new bundles, new skins, and
much more! Dive on in for more information.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly â€“ Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Team Leaders will now be chosen based solely on highest Rank.</strong></span></li>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong>. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong> only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>

<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1494956881/patchlogo2017-05-16.jpg"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/23227809" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/23227809" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 2.49.0</small></div>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just hit the Public Test Realm and will
be available for playtesting until the week of December 2, PST. As always, if
you encounter any bugs during your PTR play sessions, please stop by the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/heroes/c/ptr-bug-report">PTR
Bug Report forum</a>
to let us know about your experiences.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly â€“ Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Toy 2 Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Toy 2 Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>
</ul></li>

  Now that it has a home in fewer places, we're giving it a fairly substantial

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathlord has been a fairly awkward talent for a long
  time, providing Arthas with little output and utility, even when going for a Q
  build. We're changing it to now give Arthas a fairly potent Poke tool by
  making it possible for him to infinitely drain the Health of enemy Heroes over
  time if they stay near him, which should only become more powerful as he gets
  his other Q talents as the game goes on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has been performing very well since his
  rework. His W build is still not up to par compared to its competitors, but we
  believe it's very close, so we're slightly nerfing Sticky Wicket while also
  buffing BOOM POW since it's his lynchpin talent to make the W build come
  online. We're also nerfing the damage of RIP-Tire, as it is outperforming
  compared to Rocket Ride, as well as influencing team fights a little much,
  especially when upgraded at Level 20. We like the powerful, game-breaking
  feeling that Extra Oomph provides at Level 20 (the dream is that all talents
  at this stage of the game can feel just as epic), so we're going to hold off
  on nerfing it until we see how this change pans out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As the information can be a bit hidden, we're re-
  evaluating where we have scaling on heroes that deviates from the normal 4%
  per level. While we have some good balance reasons for doing this, Lunara's
  Nature's Toxin was not one of them. Because of this, we're changing its
  scaling to match other heroes, which will result in a decent buff in the
  early-mid game and a very slight nerf to her in the late game. Overall this

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing around quite a bit about Zagara, with
  a few goals in mind. Firstly, we believe we went a little far in reducing her
  power in the solo-lane, so we're increasing her Basic Attack damage, which
  will help her throughout the game in a way that enemies should always be able
  to react to and punish her accordingly if she misplays. We're also changing
  around her Level 1 talents to be more universally usable outside of PvE
  scenarios. For Zagara players who want to specialize in Sieging enemy bases,
  Infest will be the go-to talent on the tier, whereas the other talents will be
  more generally useful. Lastly, we're significantly buffing her late-game
  power, but making her Level 16 talents fairly impactful, which should help her
  scale into the late game as a competent damage dealer during team fights.</p>

<li><strong>The Scarlet Heist: Daily Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mobsters are back! After completing the Scarlet Heist quest line, a set of three new daily special event quests will be available.</li>
<li>Using a Special Event dialog, you can choose one of those three quests and complete it for a Scarlet Heist Chest reward, once a day, until the event ends on December 3rd, 2019, PST.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New Feature: Hero Mastery Rings</strong>
<ul>
<li>A lot of you may remember the old 'Mastery Skins' and we are excited to bring back another way for players to show off their mastery of individual Heroes. With today's patch, players will be able to spend 5,000 gold to purchase augmented Hero Rings for any Hero over the levels of 15 (Level 1) and 25 (Level 2). These Mastery Rings are permanent when purchased and will be placed over the top of the normal Hero Ring, becoming visible to all players while in a match. We are extremely excited to know what you think about these and appreciate hearing any feedback you have on them!</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="tank">Tank</h3>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2670 to 2825.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Black Soulstone [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Bonus Health reduced from 0.4% to 0.3% per Soul.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Apocalypse [R1]
<ul>
<li>Mana cost reduced from 100 to 50.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo, surprisingly, is one of the lowest winning
  Heroes in the game. That doesn't mean that he's not extremely powerful at
  times or unpopular, so we don't feel the need to make drastic changes right
  now. However, we are making a few small adjustments to make him better when
  he's behind in a game by increasing his Health until he's around 75 Souls. To
  allow Diablo to more commonly attempt to land his entire combo with
  Apocalypse, we're reducing the Mana cost. Interestingly, Apocalypse is chosen
  a lot more often, but is actually a 5% lower win rate, so we want to make the
  Heroic win more without drastically shifting the perception of its power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bruiser">Bruiser</h3>

<h4 id="artanis">Artanis</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Purifier Beam [R2]
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased from 3 to 3.2.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Movement Speed changes hurt the ability for
  Purifier Beam to stick to a target a little more than most abilities. When
  increasing Movement Speed of Heroes, we knew that Abilities would be more
  difficult to land which would require players to adjust, but Purifier Beam
  doesn't allow you to aim differently. That being said, Purifier Beam is still
  very comparable to Suppression Pulse in terms of pick rate and win rate, so we
  think a very small adjustment is in order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="rexxar">Rexxar</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Mend Pet [E]
<ul>
<li>Mana cost increased from 55 to 60.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Easy Prey [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus against Mercenaries and Minions reduced from 200% to 150%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flare [Active]
<ul>
<li>Cast range increased from 15 to 25.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hunter-Gatherer [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Bonus Healing Regeneration reduced from 1.25 to 1 per second per Regeneration Globe.</li>
<li>Maximum stacks increased from 20 to 25.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rexxar, while a niche Hero, is overperforming
  compared to his competitors. We don't think we need to nerf him too much (in
  spite of his 57%+ win rate), but he has room for another small nudge in the
  downward direction. We're targeting a few of his Talents that are much more
  powerful than the other choices on the tier so encourage a variety of Talent
  selections too (though this is secondary to trying to provide an overall nerf
  to the Hero).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="varian">Varian</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Overpower [W]
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage increased from 30% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Taunt [R1]
<ul>
<li>Health and Health Regeneration bonuses increased from 30% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Twin Blades of Fury [R3]
<ul>
<li>Base Attack Damage reduction increased from 20% to 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lionheart [Q]
<ul>
<li>Healing bonus increased from 50% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Banner of Stormwind [Active]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 45 to 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Banner of Dalaran [Active]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 45 to 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Glory to the Alliance [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Banner cooldown reduction changed from 20 seconds to 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Twin Blades is outperforming compared to other
  options, so we're slightly reducing its power and increasing the power of
  Taunt to incentivize Varian players to try tanking for their team more often.
  We're also buffing a slew of under-used talents which should give Varian
  players more options to consider when deciding how to build the hero.</p>

<h4 id="ana">Ana</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Shrike [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Healing from Shrike damage from 50 to 60%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vampiric Rounds [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Bonus Shrike Heal from stacking 5 Doses from 1.5% to .75%.</li>
<li>Added second reward: 
<ul>
<li>Increase Shrike's Heal by .25% for every Basic Attack against Heroes that have 5 Doses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slumber Shells [E]
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Sleep Dart by 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Night Terrors [E]
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces Sleep Dart cooldown.</li>
<li>Modified functionality: Gain 25% Movement for 2 seconds for every Hero hit by Sleeping Dart. When a Hero wakes, they take 10% of their maximum Health in damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Ana was one of the Heroes most affected by the
  Movement Speed change a few patches ago. We have been waiting to see where she
  stabilized at and are ready to give her some buffs to help bring her back to
  where she should be. On top of a small baseline Healing increases, we wanted
  to remove the awkwardness of the way Vampiric Rounds asked players to
  constantly target swap after 5 Shrike stacks.</p>

<h4 id="deckard">Deckard</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Healing Potion [Q]
<ul>
<li>Now displays its impending AoE to allies while the missile is in flight.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fortitude of the Faithful [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Radius increased from 5.5 to 6.5.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1/4/7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gems [Active/W]
<ul>
<li>Added functionality: Increases the damage of the unleashing Horadric Cube by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ruby [Active/W]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Trigger radius of Lesser Healing Potions increased from .5 to 1 (matching base potions).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perfect Gems [Active/W]
<ul>
<li>Now reduces the cooldown of all Gem talents to 5 seconds, instead of a flat 25 second reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite old man is still lagging behind his
  healer friends, despite the suite of buffs he's seen in the past few patches.
  Rather than pushing his numbers even higher, we're giving him a boost to
  general usability by making his potions display their impact location before
  they land and increasing the area in which his trait will function.
  Additionally, we're giving the various gem talents a bit of damage to make
  them more attractive options overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="li-li">Li Li</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>

<li>Hindering Winds [W]
<ul>
<li>Moved to level 13.</li>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>

<li>Surging Winds [W]
<ul>
<li>Moved to level 4.</li>
<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 3 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hindering Winds was a bit too effective compared to
  the other options available at level 4. Rather than nerfing it into oblivion,
  we're swapping its position with Surging Winds at level 13. This should open
  up her talent options a little bit and give us room to make further
  adjustments to the rest of her kit in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="lt-morales">Lt. Morales</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vanadium Plating [W]
<ul>
<li>New Functionality: Increases the duration of Safeguard by 1 second. While the target is Stunned or Rooted, Safeguard's armor value is increased to 50.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prolonged Safeguard [W]
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New Talent - Medi-Drone [W]
<ul>
<li>Allies with Safeguard receive 50% of the healing done by Healing Beam on other targets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Prolonged Safeguard was not a very exciting talent
  pick and its increased duration bonus was redundant against Vanadium Plating's
  duration increasing mechanic. We decided to consolidate these mechanics onto
  one talent and explore offering an entirely new mechanic for the other. This
  new replacement, Medi-Drone, gives a limited amount of multi-target healing,
  something Lt. Morales was previously lacking and often requested in your
  feedback.</p>

</ul></li>
<li>Innervate [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To help Malfurion be a little more competitive with
  other Healers, we're giving him some small base buffs to parts of his kit that
  motivate teams to pick him over his alternatives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively listening to player feedback on
  the recent rework to Whitemane, and are making some changes to her to address
  them. Overall, her Talent Tree seems to be in a much healthier spot, and with
  the addition of some new baseline mechanics, we are hoping that she now feels
  closer to the Scarlet Inquisitor we all know and love!</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> From a balance perspective Junkrat's recent changes

event, bug fixes, and more! Read on for details!</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>MacOS Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>With this patch, Heroes of the Storm will use Metal for rendering on macOS. This change ensures that Heroes is compatible with macOS Catalina and that it continues to be compatible with macOS for a long time to come. As a result, the minimum required version of macOS to run Heroes of the Storm is being increased to macOS 10.12 Sierra.</li>
<li>There are a few known issues in this release: 
<ul>
<li>Stuttering and stalling may be experienced early on in a game, particularly when the game first loads in and when the enemy team is first encountered. These stalls will get better over the course of a game and over the course of several games as macOS optimizes Heroes of the Storm behind the scenes.</li>
<li>Some outlines render black.</li>
<li>Some outlines and team color-based textures may render using colors from the color blind palette when color blind mode is disabled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We will continue to work hard to resolve these and
  any other issues as we commit to providing a quality experience for our macOS
  players.</p>

  make it better! We have updated the system to match faster for most players,
  while tightening up the rules for our higher level players. We are always

<h3 id="new-event-the-scarlet-heist">New Event: The Scarlet Heist</h3>

<p>New Tirisfal City. A town where every cop is on the take and every crook pays
their dues. From her penthouse suite atop the Scarlet Monastery Casino,
Whitemane runs the largest criminal empire this side of Tirisfal. There isn't
a deal that gets made, a job that gets pulled, a scam that gets run without
Whitemane giving her blessing and getting her cut. Until now.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Event Dates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Scarlet Heist is the fall event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of September 24 â€“ December 3. You'll be able to equip skins for Junkrat, Orphea, Sgt. Hammer, and Whitemane, and complete quests to unlock Portraits, Sprays, Emojis, and special Mounts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Scarlet Heist event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Scarlet Heist Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Scarlet Heist Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' limited-time Fall of King's Crest event in Scarlet Heist Loot Chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Orphea's plan is simple: she grabs the safe while Junkrat brings the firepower and Bama provides the getaway. Whitemane would never expect anyone to be bold (or stupid) enough to steal from the Scarlet Mafia. And that's the best thing that Orphea's crew has going for them. As you complete quests you will unlock rewards and if you can pull off the heist you'll unlock the Royal Getaway Sidecar mount.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hitting an enemy Hero no longer instantly resets the cooldown of Shadow Fissure, but instead sets it to 1.5 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Talk about fireworks?! With our last balance patch,
  we introduced some changes to Shadow Fissure that ended up causing a bit more
  mayhem than we had expected. While we like rewarding players for hitting their
  abilities, a full instant reset of the ability ended up feeling pretty bad to
  play against in a lot of circumstances. This was compounded with the changes
  we also made to Might of the Scourge, so instead of a full reset, we decided
  to dial it back a notch and set the cooldown to 1.5 seconds instead.</p>

<h2 id="new-event-the-scarlet-heist">New Event: The Scarlet Heist</h2>

<p>New Tirisfal City. A town where every cop is on the take and every crook pays
their dues. From her penthouse suite atop the Scarlet Monastery Casino,
Whitemane runs the largest criminal empire this side of Tirisfal. There isn't
a deal that gets made, a job that gets pulled, a scam that gets run without
Whitemane giving her blessing and getting her cut. Until now.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Event Dates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Scarlet Heist is the fall event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of September 24 â€“ December 3. You'll be able to equip skins for Junkrat, Orphea, Sgt. Hammer, and Whitemane, and complete quests to unlock Portraits, Sprays, Emojis, and special Mounts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Scarlet Heist event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Scarlet Heist Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Scarlet Heist Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' limited-time Fall of King's Crest event in Scarlet Heist Loot Chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Orphea's plan is simple: she grabs the safe while Junkrat brings the firepower and Bama provides the getaway. Whitemane would never expect anyone to be bold (or stupid) enough to steal from the Scarlet Mafia. And that's the best thing that Orphea's crew has going for them. As you complete quests you will unlock rewards and if you can pull off the heist you'll unlock the Royal Getaway Sidecar mount.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>â€‹Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shadow Fissure [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hitting an enemy Hero no longer instantly resets the cooldown of Shadow Fissure, but instead sets it to 1.5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Talk about fireworks?! With our last balance patch,
  we introduced some changes to Shadow Fissure that ended up causing a bit more
  mayhem than we had expected. While we like rewarding players for hitting their
  abilities, a full instant reset of the ability ended up feeling pretty bad to
  play against in a lot of circumstances. This was compounded with the changes
  we also made to Might of the Scourge, so instead of a full reset, we decided
  to dial it back a notch and set the cooldown to 1.5 seconds instead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've had a lot of discussion recently on Diablo's
  place in the meta and what makes him such a consistently popular pick, despite
  having a low win rate. We love the hero, and believe he's an incredibly fun
  Warrior to play, but we've heard complaints from players about his burst
  potential, and we agree that it can be a bit much to be killed in a double
  Shadow Charge combo post 16. To help free up other options on his 13 and 16
  tiers and to address issues with his burst, we are changing Devastating Charge
  to be a little less about his own burst damage, and more about debuffing his
  target so that his team can take advantage of his powerful initiation. In
  addition, we're buffing up his other builds so that they can be more viable
  compared to the double wall-stun combo that currently dominates his late-game
  playstyle. We hope that these changes still retain the fun of lining up the
  perfect Domination combo for those who love the playstyle while also bringing
  other ways to play him into the forefront.</p>

  a better engine to fuel his abilities. We're hoping that this makes Darkness
  Within a powerful and different feeling option compared to the other talents
  on the tier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we haven't seen a huge change in Li-Ming's
  overall power since the Movement Speed changes to the game, we took a look at
  her and wanted to give her a few buffs, particularly to under-powered talents.
  While a popular suggestion, we don't feel that it's necessary yet to increase
  the speed of her Ability casts. We'll continue to keep an eye on her as we get
  more data on her performance over time.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tychus's Level 1 talents have traditionally not been

<h4 id="valla">Valla</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Upon completing the quest, Vault's Mana cost is reduced from 50 to 25.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since Valla has a fair bit of Mana tension, and to be
  consistent with other talents that significantly reduce the cooldown of an
  ability, we're giving a Mana reduction to Vault on Caltrops so that it remains
  Mana-neutral when the quest is completed.</p>

<li><strong>Qhira</strong>
<ul>
<li>Qhira's Grappling Hook should no longer pull her after she has been Rooted.</li>
<li>Qhira's Grappling Hook visuals should clean up correctly if she dies at the same time it connects.</li>
<li>Qhira's Revolving Sweep kinetics have been cleaned up and should play nicer with sub-game-loop interactions.</li>
