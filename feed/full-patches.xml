<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making a few changes to Chromie to reduce the
  frustration when playing against her and to reduce her wide power variance
  between games. A number of these changes are designed to increase counter-play
  when playing against Chromie, like reducing her range on her abilities and
  letting enemies see Dragon's Breath shortly after it has been cast. In
  exchange, Chromie's Sand Blast has a shorter cast time, and she will now have
  a modified version of Bronze Talons baseline, where she can weave in auto-
  attacks for hitting enemy Heroes with her abilities. The reason we decided to
  give her the additional Bronze Talons trait is so that Chromie players are
  encouraged to interact more with their opponents. We're rewarding them for
  getting into more dangerous positions with the possibility of increased damage
  output. This also lets us redistribute her damage away from her high burst,
  long range abilities, and more into something her opponents have a better
  opportunity to play around. We like Chromie's unique place in our game as a
  long-range, artillery mage that requires enemies to pay attention to their
  positioning but over time we found that she simply had too much range and
  burst for players to feel like they had an engaging experience when playing
  against her. While we've had a blast with these changes, we'll continue to
  keep an eye on her going forward and are prepared to make additional tweaks as
  needed.</p>

  we felt that Stukov could use some love in the talent diversity department.
  We've made a number of functionality changes that should open up new builds
  and play styles, particularly in his earlier talent tiers.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hanzo, while extremely desired and powerful in
  professional play, doesn't have the same success across all levels of Hero
  League. We think that by reducing the power of Sonic Arrow and shifting that
  into Basic Attacks, not only will Redemption be a more attractive option, but
  Hanzo's success should rise in Hero League without making him any more
  powerful in organized team play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan's win rate has slowly crept up as players get
  the hang of his rework, but we feel his PvE inclined elements are less
  impactful then we'd like. We're making a number of small adjustments to
  Azmodan's various Demons and All Shall Burn to help ensure their talents are
  competitive choices. We're also giving Globe a bit more baseline damage at the
  cost of its scaling to make it slightly easier to stack early in the game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're adjusting Fish Tank to not be so binary in the
  situations where it is powerful. While granting 75 Physical Armor was an
  appropriate amount of power against the other talents on the tier, it resulted
  in some situations where Murky could not be killed when playing against
  certain enemies. We're changing the talent to be more generally useful so that
  Murky can get a lot of value as long as he is hitting enemies, but he can
  still be killed by more conventional methods.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> This change is to address situations where Orbital
  BFG could kill enemy Forts, Keeps, and potentially end the game with no
  counter-play from the opposing team. We realize that this is a minor nerf to
  Blunt Force Gun and a fairly hefty nerf to Orbital BFG. Both talents are
  performing well right now, so we will be waiting to see if they need a buff in
  some other area to compensate for this loss in functionality.</p>

<p>Our latest Heroes of the Storm patch includes improvements for ranked play,
major Hero updates for Raynor and Azmodan, new skins, and more!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ranked-play">Ranked Play</h3>

<p><strong>2018 Ranked Season 3 Has Begun!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ranked rewards have been granted to players based on their performance during 2018 Ranked Season 2.</li>
<li>Learn more about the rewards that are up for grabs during the new season by checking out our <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/blog/21905735">2018 Ranked Season 3 Dates and Rewards blog</a>.</li>
<li>A number of ranked play improvements have also been made with the start of 2018 Ranked Season 3, including the addition of a third ban, rank decay, seeding changes, and Hero League matchmaking adjustments. Read on for details.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Third Ban</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A third Hero ban has been added to draft modes as part of the initial ban phase.
<ul>
<li>During the initial ban phase, teams will alternate until each has banned two Heroes.</li>
<li>Ban and pick times have been adjusted in order to offset the addition of the new ban.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The number of level 5+ Heroes required to participate in Hero League has been increased from 14 to 16 to ensure players will always have a Hero available if they pick last.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rank Decay</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Diamond, Master, and Grand Master Hero League players who have placed in the current season but haven't completed any games in a while will be considered “inactive”.</li>
<li>Once a player becomes inactive, they will receive a small amount of rank and MMR decay each day until they complete one Hero League match.
<ul>
<li>Diamond, Master, and Grand Master each have their own threshold for inactivity.</li>
<li>Players can earn additional “grace period” days by regularly playing Hero League matches during the current season.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inactive players can avoid decay and regain active status by playing a single Hero League match to completion.</li>
</ul>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>League</th>
  <th>Inactive Days Before Decay</th>
  <th>Extra "Grace Period" Days</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Diamond</strong></td>
  <td>20</td>
  <td>10</td>

  <td><strong>Master</strong></td>
  <td>15</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Grand Master</strong></td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Seeding Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players who enter ranked play for the first time can no longer be seeded into placement matches higher than Gold 5.</li>
<li>Players who return to Hero League after an extended break will no longer be re-seeded into placement matches based on their performance in other modes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero League Matchmaking Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ratings Rather Than Points</strong>
<ul>
<li>For Master and Grand Master players, the Master-level players they are matched with and against are now determined by skill rating, and rank points no longer play a role.
<ul>
<li>This should provide better experiences for players of very high skill levels who start playing later in a season.</li>
<li>These players' games should have allies and opponents of more consistent skill levels, which also match their own.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Match Quality Restrictions and Notifications</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players below Master who have waited fewer than three minutes in queue will not be placed into any matches that are outside of the game quality restrictions that would have been used if the match had been formed around that player.</li>
<li>Players will now receive a notification in the UI when these quality restrictions are expanded in order to help them find a match more quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stricter Rank Difference Requirements</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players will now only be matched with allies and opponents who are within 1 division of their own ranks. This means:
<ul>
<li>Master players can be matched with players who are either ranked Diamond 1 or Grand Master, but never both.</li>
<li>Grand Master players will not be matched with players below Masters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This restriction will not loosen for players in Europe and North America. However, it can loosen for players in other regions after they have waited in queue for 1 hour.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stricter Rating Differences</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players now have narrower ranges of acceptable skill ratings for the players they are matched with. For example:
<ul>
<li>It is extremely unlikely that a top Grand Master player will be matched with a Master who is on the cusp of demotion to Diamond.</li>
<li>If a Master player is placed into a Grand Master game, it is because that player's skill rating is very similar to that of the Grand Master players.
<ul>
<li>In this situation, the Master player's ranked points have not yet caught up to their rating.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Non-Ranked Battleground Pool</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>All Battlegrounds that were temporarily removed during the Echoes of Alterac event have returned to Versus A.I., Quick Match, and Unranked matchmaking queues.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Heroes can no longer Heal, Shield, or target allied Mercenaries with Abilities unless an Ability specifically states that Mercenaries are valid targets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alterac Pass</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Giants</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack speed reduced by approximately 30%.</li>
<li>Neutral Ice Giant Attack damage increased from 240 to 312.</li>
<li>Captured Ice Giant Attack damage increased from 400 to 520.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cavalry</strong>
<ul>
<li>The damage bonus provided by Cavalry units is now a flat 10%, and no longer scales with each completed event.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Minimap</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Minimap icons that represent Immortals during an event have received updates.
<ul>
<li>The opposing Immortal now uses an icon depicting crossed axes, while the allied Immortal displays a shield icon.</li>
<li>This should help players more quickly identify which Immortal to attack and which to defend.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beacons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now become contested immediately when Heroes from both teams are on the point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zerg Waves</strong> <a class="label label-warning" href="https://twitter.com/ChaosOS_59/status/1016024635975061505" target="_blank">Undocumented <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
<ul>
<li>The baseline zerg wave has been strengthened significantly.
<ul>
<li>This should encourage teams to split up in order to defend against an incoming zerg wave, rather than send all five players to attack with an allied wave.</li>
<li><span class="text-warning">Base wave increased from 6 zerglings to 10 zerglings, 2 hydralisks, 1 guardian, and 1 ultralisk.</span></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're extremely excited to bring Raynor's long-
  awaited rework to the Nexus! We've been reading and absorbing all the amazing
  feedback that you have sent us over the past year and think the new design
  will do him justice. We've massively increased his wave-clear potential with a
  new Trait and completely overhauled his Talent tree (one of the oldest in the
  game). Raynor mains should have a whole new set of tools to play around with
  while new users should still be able to pick him up and right-click their way
  to victory. We have been having a ton of fun with the changes and hope you do
  as well. As always, please send us any feedback you have and get ready to fill
  your enemies full of daylight!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In Azmodan's update, we've embraced and expanded his
  role as a late-game siege monster. He now has a baseline stacking quest for
  Globe of Annihilation that's a hybrid of the old Taste for Blood and Sieging
  Wrath Talents. Whether you're focusing on PvE or PvP objectives you should see
  Globe of Annihilation become more powerful as a game goes on. To compensate
  for this increase in baseline power, we've made Globe's impact area more
  quickly visible to enemies, which will give them a chance to dodge their
  impending doom. We've also made major mechanical changes to Black Pool (now
  called Tide of Sin) and focused it solely on Globe's damage without the need
  for targeting or alt-casting. Demon Warriors are now individually stronger and
  deal constant AoE damage, but are slower and no longer have multiple charges.
  The new All Shall Burn should be much more consistently useful and certain
  Talent combinations can be used boost Azmodan's short to mid-range potential.
  Demon Lieutenant (formerly General Of Hell) is still a global pushing ability,
  but is less reliant on needing a large Minion wave to get value. Demonic
  Invasion's changes are geared towards expanding its use in PvP scenarios
  without affecting its old structure-bustin' potential. Dropping an Invasion on
  the enemy team will force them to run away or take a large amount of delayed
  damage.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Battlegrounds</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Warhead Junction:</strong> Visual effects created by Boss and Podling Abilities are no longer visible through the Fog of War.</li>
<li><strong>Try Mode:</strong> Changing the Enemy Hero setting to None and then using the Set Level button no longer causes an enemy Hero to spawn.</li>

<li><strong>Alexstrasza:</strong> Can no longer use Cleansing Flame to switch between the upper and lower levels of Haunted Mines.</li>
<li><strong>Alexstrasza:</strong> Fixed an issue that could cause Cleansing Flame to fail if it was cast in the same moment that Dragonqueen was ending.</li>
<li><strong>Cassia:</strong> Fixed an issue in which the Plate of the Whale Talent required more Basic Attacks to be absorbed per Health Regeneration stack than intended.</li>
<li><strong>Deckard:</strong> Can now correctly use Healing Potions while affected by Zarya's Graviton Surge.</li>
<li><strong>Deckard:</strong> Canceling Stay Awhile and Listen no longer prevents the next source of damage from waking Sleeping enemies.</li>

<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Damage over time effects that do not initially apply damage, like Gul'dan's Corruption and Blaze's Combustion, will now correctly wake Sleeping enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Stukov:</strong> Healing Pathogen's timer is no longer visually removed if the target becomes Polymorphed.</li>
<li><strong>Takedown Credit:</strong> Fixed an issue in which takedown credit could still be granted to a Hero even if they left combat long before the target was killed.</li>
<li><strong>The Butcher:</strong> Ruthless Onslaught's visual effects will no longer persist on the target if they interrupt the Ability by entering Stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Valeera:</strong> Sinister Strike's targeting indicator now more closely matches the Ability's area of effect.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Sound</strong></p>

<ul>

<p>We've just applied a number of balance changes to the Alterac Pass
Battleground.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Alterac Pass</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generals</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 24,000 to 20,000.</li>
<li>Now gain 405 maximum Health every minute until minute 21 (excluding minute 1).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cavalry</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer gain additional Armor for nearby Heroes.</li>
<li>Health reduced from 10,000 to 8,000.</li>
<li>Health scaling increased by 19%.</li>
<li>Damage reduced from 85 to 65.</li>
<li>Damage scaling increased by 22%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reaver Minions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage scaling increased by 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making a few changes to Alterac Pass to reduce
  the frequency that one team can run away with an early lead, while still
  keeping the average game time roughly in line with our other Battlegrounds.
  We're removing the mechanic that grants Cavalry additional Armor for every
  allied Hero in their aura, since we feel that multi-Hero pushes are already
  strong enough. We've also made Health scaling adjustments so that Vanndar and
  Drek'thar (the Core replacements) won't be demolished as quickly by late game
  Heroes that have outscaled them and reduced their Armor. However, we are
  increasing the scaling of Cavalry and Reavers (Catapult replacements), so that
  games still end in a timely fashion. This should only come into play during
  games that become prolonged.</p>

<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1494956881/patchlogo2017-05-16.jpg"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/21907096" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/21907096" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 2.35.0</small></div>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just hit the Public Test Realm and will
be available for playtesting until July 9. As always, if you encounter any
bugs during your PTR play sessions, please stop by the <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/forum/20013840/">PTR Bug Report
forum</a> to let us know about
your experiences.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ranked-play">Ranked Play</h3>

<p><strong>Third Ban</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A third Hero ban has been added to draft modes as part of the initial ban phase.
<ul>
<li>During the initial ban phase, teams will alternate until each has banned two Heroes.</li>
<li>Ban and pick times have been adjusted in order to offset the addition of the new ban.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The number of level 5+ Heroes required to participate in Hero League has been increased from 14 to 16 to ensure players will always have a Hero available if they pick last.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rank Point Decay</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Diamond, Master, and Grand Master Hero League players who have placed in the current season but haven't completed any games in a while will be considered “inactive”.</li>
<li>Once a player becomes inactive, they will receive a small amount of rank and MMR decay each day until they complete one Hero League match.
<ul>
<li>Diamond, Master, and Grand Master each have their own threshold for inactivity.</li>
<li>Players can earn additional “grace period” days by regularly playing Hero League matches during the current season.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inactive players can avoid decay and regain active status by playing a single Hero League match to completion.</li>
</ul>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>League</th>
  <th>Inactive Days Before Decay</th>
  <th>Extra "Grace Period" Days</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Diamond</strong></td>
  <td>20</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Master</strong></td>
  <td>15</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Grand Master</strong></td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Seeding Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players who enter ranked play for the first time can no longer be seeded into placement matches higher than Gold 5.</li>
<li>Players who return to Hero League after an extended break will no longer be re-seeded into placement matches based on their performance in other modes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero League Matchmaking Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ratings Rather Than Points</strong>
<ul>
<li>For Master and Grand Master players, the Master-level players they are matched with and against are now determined by skill rating, and rank points no longer play a role.
<ul>
<li>This should provide better experiences for players of very high skill levels who start playing later in a season.</li>
<li>These players' games should have allies and opponents of more consistent skill levels, which also match their own.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Match Quality Restrictions and Notifications</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players below Master who have waited fewer than three minutes in queue will not be placed into any matches that are outside of the game quality restrictions that would have been used if the match had been formed around that player.</li>
<li>Players will now receive a notification in the UI when these quality restrictions are expanded in order to help them find a match more quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stricter Rank Difference Requirements</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players will now only be matched with allies and opponents who are within 1 division of their own ranks. This means:
<ul>
<li>Master players can be matched with players who are either ranked Diamond 1 or Grand Master, but never both.</li>
<li>Grand Master players will not be matched with players below Masters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This restriction will not loosen for players in Europe and North America. However, it can loosen for players in other regions after they have waited in queue for 1 hour.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stricter Rating Differences</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players now have narrower ranges of acceptable skill ratings for the players they are matched with. For example:
<ul>
<li>It is extremely unlikely that a top Grand Master player will be matched with a Master who is on the cusp of demotion to Diamond.</li>
<li>If a Master player is placed into a Grand Master game, it is because that player's skill rating is very similar to that of the Grand Master players.
<ul>
<li>In this situation, the Master player's ranked points have not yet caught up to their rating.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Heroes can no longer Heal, Shield, or target allied Mercenaries with Abilities unless an Ability specifically states that Mercenaries are valid targets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alterac Pass</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Giants</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack speed reduced by approximately 30%.</li>
<li>Neutral Ice Giant Attack damage increased from 240 to 312.</li>
<li>Captured Ice Giant Attack damage increased from 400 to 520.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cavalry</strong>
<ul>
<li>The damage bonus provided by Cavalry units is now a flat 10%, and no longer scales with each completed event.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Minimap</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Minimap icons that represent Immortals during an event have received updates.
<ul>
<li>The opposing Immortal now uses an icon depicting crossed axes, while the allied Immortal displays a shield icon.</li>
<li>This should help players more quickly identify which Immortal to attack and which to defend.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beacons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now become contested immediately when Heroes from both teams are on the point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zerg Waves</strong> <a class="label label-warning" href="https://twitter.com/ChaosOS_59/status/1016024635975061505" target="_blank">Undocumented <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
<ul>
<li>The baseline zerg wave has been strengthened significantly.
<ul>
<li>This should encourage teams to split up in order to defend against an incoming zerg wave, rather than send all five players to attack with an allied wave.</li>
<li><span class="text-warning">Base wave increased from 6 zerglings to 10 zerglings, 2 hydralisks, 1 guardian, and 1 ultralisk.</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beacon Progress Bars</strong> <a class="label label-warning" href="https://twitter.com/ChaosOS_59/status/1016024635975061505" target="_blank">Undocumented <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
<ul>
<li>The progress bars in the lower-right corner of the screen have received visual updates to coincide with the above changes.</li>
<li><span class="text-warning">Total beacon capture time increased from 30 seconds to 37.5 seconds.</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning">Time between 2% intervals increased from 0.6 seconds to 0.75 seconds.</span></li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're extremely excited to bring Raynor's long-
  awaited rework to the Nexus! We've been reading and absorbing all the amazing
  feedback that you have sent us over the past year and think the new design
  will do him justice. We've massively increased his wave-clear potential with a
  new Trait and completely overhauled his Talent tree (one of the oldest in the
  game). Raynor mains should have a whole new set of tools to play around with
  while new users should still be able to pick him up and right-click their way
  to victory. We have been having a ton of fun with the changes and hope you do
  as well. As always, please send us any feedback you have and get ready to fill
  your enemies full of daylight!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In Azmodan's update, we've embraced and expanded his
  role as a late-game siege monster. He now has a baseline stacking quest for
  Globe of Annihilation that's a hybrid of the old Taste for Blood and Sieging
  Wrath Talents. Whether you're focusing on PvE or PvP objectives you should see
  Globe of Annihilation become more powerful as a game goes on. To compensate
  for this increase in baseline power, we've made Globe's impact area more
  quickly visible to enemies, which will give them a chance to dodge their
  impending doom. We've also made major mechanical changes to Black Pool (now
  called Tide of Sin) and focused it solely on Globe's damage without the need
  for targeting or alt-casting. Demon Warriors are now individually stronger and
  deal constant AoE damage, but are slower and no longer have multiple charges.
  The new All Shall Burn should be much more consistently useful and certain
  Talent combinations can be used boost Azmodan's short to mid-range potential.
  Demon Lieutenant (formerly General Of Hell) is still a global pushing ability,
  but is less reliant on needing a large Minion wave to get value. Demonic
  Invasion's changes are geared towards expanding its use in PvP scenarios
  without affecting its old structure-bustin' potential. Dropping an Invasion on
  the enemy team will force them to run away or take a large amount of delayed
  damage.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Amani Rage has become a staple in almost every build
  for Zul'jin. We love that it creates meaningful moments and synergizes with
  his kit, so we made it a baseline ability but had to take a little power out
  of it to compensate. We've created Amani Hide as an upgrade for it that brings
  back the armor functionality players are accustomed to.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> By increasing the healing potential of Chain Heal,
  Rehgar will feel more dynamic before level 10. He will also rely less on
  Ancestral to create the healing output needed from a healer. The cooldown
  reduction will also make Tidal Waves, Earthliving Enchant, and Blood and
  Thunder more attractive picks on their respective tiers. We're reducing the
  healing of Ancestral some to compensate for his stronger base kit. During
  internal testing prior to making this change, we found the extra healing it
  offered frequently resulted in overhealing. As a result, we think this healing
  reduction won't feel as impactful as it might initially seem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now that we've removed Anub'arak's baseline Spell
  Armor, we've also decided to normalize his Nullification Shield Talent. Since
  Harden Carapace provides him with a healthy amount of Spell Armor, it now
  shares a lot of the same design space with Nullification Shield. We want to
  make the use case for his Level 20 Talent clearer, which is to simply press
  the button when in a lot of trouble to survive burst damage.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've seen Yrel trending upward strongly since her
  release, most likely due to players beginning to master her unique playstyle.
  We've seen a large difference between players who have a lot of experience as
  Yrel (Hero level 10+) and people who are still learning the Hero. This is
  likely why we've seen her rise from her initial winrate of 40% to her current
  46%. That said, we would like her to feel a little more powerful and be
  countered by enemy picks a little less. We've increased Avenging Wrath's
  damage so she gains a little wave clear (though she'll have to use her escape
  to do so), while also allowing her to threaten enemy backlines. By reducing
  the cooldown of Divine Purpose, Yrel players won't need to channel as
  frequently which will result in fewer interrupts. We've also made several
  Talent changes to buff a few that were underperforming, and to offset the
  lower Divine Purpose cooldown.</p>

<p>An age-old rivalry has flared up as the Horde and Alliance battle for
dominance over a strategic pass through the Alterac Mountains. Generals from
each faction rally Heroes to their banners in an effort to gain the upper-hand

<h3 id="new-battleground-alterac-pass">New Battleground: Alterac Pass</h3>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>Please Note:</strong> Alterac Pass will become available for play in two stages during the coming weeks:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Non-Ranked Modes:</strong> During the week of June 19, Alterac Pass will enter Quick Match, Unranked, and Versus A.I. matchmaking queues, as well as Custom Games.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Ranked Play:</strong> During the week of July 10, Alterac Pass will enter the Ranked Battleground Rotation.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Learn even more about Alterac Pass by visiting the <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/battlegrounds/alterac-pass/">Heroes of the Storm
website</a>!</em></p>

<p>Alterac Pass is a 3-lane Battleground where Heroes must free imprisoned allied
troops, call in their cavalry, and take down the opposing General to claim the
Pass for their faction. In addition to enemy forces, the Alterac Mountains are
home to many treacherous hazards! Heroes must remain vigilant, as a misstep
into a mud pit can prove fatal. Teams would also be wise to recruit the
Armored Gnolls and Ice Giants who inhabit the Pass before the enemy faction
can harness these deadly creatures for their own gain.</p>

<p><strong>Cores Replaced by Generals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each team's Core has been replaced by a General who will aid them in fending off attackers.
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanndar Stormpike</strong> leads the Alliance (left team) in driving back the Horde forces at Alterac Pass.</li>
<li><strong>Drek'Thar</strong> has rallied the Horde (right team) to aid in defending the Pass against Alliance invaders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each General receives bonus Armor and damage based on the number of allied Keeps remaining. Destroy enemy Keeps to weaken their General.</li>
<li>When attacking a General directly, be prepared to finish the job! Vanndar and Drek'thar will regenerate Health once they are out of combat.</li>
<li>In addition to their Basic Attacks, they can also use two Abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Whirlwind:</strong> Deals damage in an area around the General.</li>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> The General dashes to the target enemy, dealing damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Capture Prison Camps to Call in the Cavalry!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Three minutes after a match begins, a Prison Camp will spawn for each team. Invade enemy territory, take out the Guards, and free the allied prisoners to call in a Cavalry Charge!
<ul>
<li>Channel an opposing Prison Camp to begin a breakout, and then free the prisoner by preventing the enemy team from regaining control of the Camp for 30 seconds.
<ul>
<li>Watch out for enemy Heroes and Guards! They will attempt to stop any attackers and Channel on their Prison Camp to retake control.</li>
<li>Each subsequent breakout will require the capturing team to maintain control for an additional 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once a team frees the prisoners at an enemy camp, allied Cavalry will charge down all three lanes, attacking any enemies and Structures in their paths.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry units generate an aura that increases nearby Minion and Hero Movement Speeds, and grants a damage bonus to nearby allied Heroes.
<ul>
<li>The aura's damage bonus will increase based on the number of Prison Camp events completed so far, up to a maximum of 3 events.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry on both teams will benefit from these increases independent of which team won each Prison Camp event.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subsequent Prison Camps will spawn at random within a range of time after all Cavalry from the previous event have been eliminated. This range of time is determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>From 110 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds to 150 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds.</li>
<li><strong>For example:</strong> If all Cavalry from the most recent event are defeated at the 10-minute mark, the next set of Prison Camps will spawn at random between 90 and 130 seconds later.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Armored Gnolls – Siege Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Watch out for the Gnolls who inhabit the Pass! They're formidable creatures who wield a cleaving attack that can shred a Hero's Armor in no time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ice Giants – Boss Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Ice Giants at the northern and southernmost points of the Pass tend to mind their own business, but once provoked, they've been known to hurl deadly balls of ice and even stomp the ground in an effort to Slow or Stun their foes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mud Pits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Combatants who don't mind where they step can fall victim to one of several mud pits that have sprung up within Alterac Pass.
<ul>
<li>Any Hero who enters a mud pit will find their Movement Speed reduced by 16% per second, to a maximum of 60%, for as long as they remain there.</li>
<li>Upon finding solid ground, the Hero will regain Movement Speed at 50% per second.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The bonus damage dealt by Warheads had very little
  counterplay in late-game situations. Teams could hoard Warheads and kill any
  Structure—including the Core—very quickly. Although this center bonus damage
  presented players with interesting decision points, the mechanic's problems
  outweighed its positives. We feel encouraging players to hit as many
  structures as possible is a similarly fun mechanic that is healthier for the
  game.</span></p>

<p>We've just released a new Heroes of the Storm patch to apply a number of
balance changes and bug fixes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>Main Menu</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The region selector dropdown has been removed from the Main Menu (ESC) in order to help prevent edge-case issues that could affect other game features and result in a poor experience for the player.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p><strong>Armor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Baseline Armor has been removed from a number of Heroes. Please see the specific changes to individual Heroes below.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have experimented with baseline Armor on some of
  our Heroes for some time, but we've decided to remove this functionality for
  now. The problem with it that we've found over time is that baseline Armor was
  difficult to communicate visually. It therefore ended up being a largely
  hidden power that didn't have any major changes on gameplay. Going forward,
  we'll prefer to make Armor—and other mechanics that are effective against
  Heroes and damage types—more interesting when they are tied to game mechanics.
  To clarify, while we are removing baseline Armor from Heroes, we still like
  Armor that is tied to a window of time or has an obvious display on the Hero
  when it is active. Some examples include Greymane in Worgen form and
  Cho'gall's Ogre hide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,000 to 1,200</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,650 to 2,050</li>
<li><strong>Towers of Doom</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,100 to 1,200.</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,900 to 2,050.
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Note:</strong> Towers of Doom Forts upgrade to Keeps when the Tunnels open, approximately 12 minutes into a match.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking some of the experience offered by outer
  Towers and distributing it amongst other Structures in an effort to keep teams
  closer in levels for a little while longer. We still want to reward skillful
  play, but a team that completes the first objective is frequently able take
  out a lot of the opposing team's outer Structures. Not only did this open up a
  strategic advantage (Healing Fountains get destroyed, Fortifications provide
  less safety), but it also pushes the winning team further ahead. Usually, this
  results in one team reaching level 10 before their opponents, allowing them to
  snowball to an even greater lead. We'd like to instead slow down early game
  leads, so that winning teams have to play well for a longer period of time.</p>

<li><strong>Spirit of Vengeance (E)</strong>

<li>Cooldown increased from 10 to 13 seconds.</li>
<li>Damage increased from 100 to 180.</li>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>No longer deals bonus damage to Heroes.</li>
<li>Instead, if Spirit of Vengeance hits an enemy Hero, its cooldown is reduced by 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Blade Dance (Q)
<ul>
<li>Area of effect reduced from 4 to 3.5.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The cooldown increase for Umbral Bind will grant the
  Warden's enemies a bit more of a reprieve between cases of being chained. We
  are also shifting some of the complexity of Spirit of Vengeance into cooldown
  reduction upon hitting a Hero, rather than providing bonus Hero damage. This
  increases Maiev's capability for wave-clear, rewards players that use the
  ability to engage, and reduces its usefulness as an escape. Overall, Maiev's
  kit is still slightly over-performing, and we're hoping these changes will get
  her into a sweet spot.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lunara's rework has put her pick rate, win rate, and
  Talent pick rates in a pretty good spot. These changes are to address Talent
  outliers, which we'll continue to keep an eye on going forward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Nexus has changed a lot since Zagara first
  arrived. Originally, she was the ultimate lane bully, known for pushing
  enemies out of lane with Hunter Killer and draining tower ammo with her
  summons. The arrival of new solo-laners who can challenge her power, combined
  with the removal of tower ammo, has made this part of her identity less
  special. The goals of these changes are twofold: first, to slightly reduce her
  early-game laning presence, largely by reducing the early-game Health of
  Hunter Killer. Our second goal is to buff her late-game teamfight capability,
  which we're doing by improving the scaling on her abilities. Our general
  thinking is that she is mostly frustrating to lane against during the early
  game, and then she falls off in power and has less impact in teamfights, which
  results in allies relying on her to split-push instead of playing with her
  team. We're hoping that with these changes she will be a more standard Hero in
  team compositions, and can be played as a solid backline damage dealer.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo is underperforming since his recent rework, so
  we've increased his baseline survivability. We expect him to rise as players
  settle into new builds and playstyles, but there was still room to buff the
  Lord of Terror. We've also addressed a few of the Talents that weren't as
  strong as their counterparts. Additionally, we've reduced the duration of
  Feast on Fear, but increased its healing per tick, so Diablo players can get
  more value out of a few healing ticks before overriding it.</p>

<p><strong><em>PTR Note:</em></strong> <em>While elements of this event may be visible on the Public Test Realm, any progress or rewards earned during PTR testing will not transfer to the live version of the game when this patch is officially released next week.</em></p>

will not tolerate traitors among their ranks.</p>

<h3 id="new-battleground-alterac-pass">New Battleground: Alterac Pass</h3>

<p><em>Learn even more about Alterac Pass by visiting the <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/battlegrounds/alterac-pass/">Heroes of the Storm
website</a>!</em></p>

<p>Alterac Pass is a three-lane Battleground where Heroes must free imprisoned
allied troops, call in their cavalry, and take down the opposing General to
claim the Pass for their faction. In addition to enemy forces, the Alterac
Mountains are home to many treacherous hazards! Heroes must remain vigilant,
as a simple misstep into a mud pit can prove fatal. As well, teams would be
wise to recruit the Armored Gnolls and Ice Giants who inhabit the Pass before
the enemy faction can harness the deadly creatures for their own gain.</p>

<p><strong>Cores Replaced by Generals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each team's Core has been replaced by a General who will aid them in fending off attackers.
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanndar Stormpike</strong> leads the Alliance (left team) in driving back the Horde forces at Alterac Pass.</li>
<li><strong>Drek'Thar</strong> has rallied the Horde (right team) to aid in defending the Pass against Alliance invaders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each General receives bonus Armor and damage based on the number of allied Keeps remaining. Destroy enemy Keeps to weaken their General.</li>
<li>When attacking a General directly, be prepared to finish the job! Vanndar and Drek'thar will regenerate Health once they are out of combat.</li>
<li>In addition to their Basic Attacks, they can also use two Abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Whirlwind:</strong> Deals damage in an area around the General.</li>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> The General dashes to the target enemy, dealing damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Capture Prison Camps to Call in the Cavalry!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Three minutes after a match begins, a Prison Camp will spawn for each team. Invade enemy territory to reach the opposing Prison Camp, take out the Guards, and free the allied prisoners to call in a Cavalry Charge!
<ul>
<li>Channel an opposing Prison Camp to begin a breakout, and then free the prisoner by preventing the enemy team from regaining control of the Camp for 30 seconds.
<ul>
<li>Watch out for enemy Heroes and Guards! They will attempt to stop any attackers and Channel on their Prison Camp to retake control.</li>
<li>Each subsequent breakout will require the capturing team to maintain control for an additional 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once a team frees the prisoners at an enemy camp, allied Cavalry will charge down all three lanes, attacking any enemies and Structures in their paths.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry units generate an aura that increases nearby Minion and Hero Movement Speeds, and grants a damage bonus to nearby allied Heroes.
<ul>
<li>The aura's damage bonus will increase based on the number of Prison Camp events completed so far, up to a maximum of 3 events.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry on both teams will benefit from these increases independent of which team won each Prison Camp event.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subsequent Prison Camps will spawn at random within a range of time after all Cavalry from the previous event have been eliminated. This range of time is determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>From 110 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds to 150 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds.</li>
<li><strong>For example:</strong> If all Cavalry from the most recent event are defeated at the 10-minute mark, the next set of Prison Camps will spawn at random between 90 and 130 seconds later.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Armored Gnolls – Siege Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Watch out for the Gnolls who inhabit the Pass! They're formidable creatures who wield a cleaving attack that can shred a Hero's Armor in no time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ice Giants – Boss Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Ice Giants at the northern and southernmost points of the Pass tend to mind their own business, but once provoked, they've been known to hurl deadly balls of ice—and even stomp the ground in an effort to Slow or Stun their foes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mud Pits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Combatants who don't mind where they step can fall victim to one of several mud pits that have sprung up within Alterac Pass.
<ul>
<li>Any Hero who enters a mud pit will find their Movement Speed reduced by 16% per second, to a maximum of 60%, for as long as they remain there.</li>
<li>Upon finding solid ground, the Hero will regain Movement Speed at 50% per second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Alterac Pass will become available for play in three stages over the next few weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Public Test Realm:</strong> Alterac Pass is available for play in the PTR from today until June 11.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Ranked Modes:</strong> During the week of June 19, Alterac Pass will enter Quick Match, Unranked, and Versus A.I. matchmaking queues, as well as Custom Games.</li>
<li><strong>Ranked Play:</strong> During the week of July 10, Alterac Pass will enter the Ranked Battleground Rotation.</li>

<p><strong>PTR Note:</strong> The following changes to Armor and Structures are present on the Public Test Realm but will be added to the live version of Heroes of the Storm in a separate balance patch within the next few days.</p>

<p><strong>Armor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Baseline Armor has been removed from a number of Heroes. Please see the specific changes to individual Heroes below.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have experimented with baseline Armor on some of
  our Heroes for some time, but we've decided to remove this functionality for
  now. The problem with it that we've found over time is that baseline Armor was
  difficult to communicate visually. It therefore ended up being a largely
  hidden power that didn't have any major changes on gameplay. Going forward,
  we'll prefer to make Armor—and other mechanics that are effective against
  Heroes and damage types—more interesting when they are tied to game mechanics.
  To clarify, while we are removing baseline Armor from Heroes, we still like
  Armor that is tied to a window of time or has an obvious display on the Hero
  when it is active. Some examples include Greymane in Worgen form and
  Cho'gall's Ogre hide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,000 to 1,200</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,650 to 2,050</li>
<li><strong>Towers of Doom</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,100 to 1,200.</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,900 to 2,050.
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Note:</strong> Towers of Doom Forts upgrade to Keeps when the Tunnels open, approximately 12 minutes into a match.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking some of the experience offered by outer
  Towers and distributing it amongst other Structures in an effort to keep teams
  closer in levels for a little while longer. We still want to reward skillful
  play, but a team that completes the first objective is frequently able take
  out a lot of the opposing team's outer Structures. Not only did this open up a
  strategic advantage (Healing Fountains get destroyed, Fortifications provide
  less safety), but it also pushes the winning team further ahead. Usually, this
  results in one team reaching level 10 before their opponents, allowing them to
  snowball to an even greater lead. We'd like to instead slow down early game
  leads, so that winning teams have to play well for a longer period of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The cooldown increase for Umbral Bind will grant the
  Warden's enemies a bit more of a reprieve between cases of being chained. We
  are also shifting some of the complexity of Spirit of Vengeance into cooldown
  reduction upon hitting a Hero, rather than providing bonus Hero damage. This
  increases Maiev's capability for wave-clear, rewards players that use the
  ability to engage, and reduces its usefulness as an escape. Overall, Maiev's
  kit is still slightly over-performing, and we're hoping these changes will get
  her into a sweet spot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Nexus has changed a lot since Zagara first
  arrived. Originally, she was the ultimate lane bully, known for pushing
  enemies out of lane with Hunter Killer and draining tower ammo with her
  summons. The arrival of new solo-laners who can challenge her power, combined
  with the removal of tower ammo, has made this part of her identity less
  special. The goals of these changes are twofold: first, to slightly reduce her
  early-game laning presence, largely by reducing the early-game Health of
  Hunter Killer. Our second goal is to buff her late-game teamfight capability,
  which we're doing by improving the scaling on her abilities. Our general
  thinking is that she is mostly frustrating to lane against during the early
  game, and then she falls off in power and has less impact in teamfights, which
  results in allies relying on her to split-push instead of playing with her
  team. We're hoping that with these changes she will be a more standard Hero in
  team compositions, and can be played as a solid backline damage dealer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo is underperforming since his recent rework, so
  we've increased his baseline survivability. We expect him to rise as players
  settle into new builds and playstyles, but there was still room to buff the
  Lord of Terror. We've also addressed a few of the Talents that weren't as
  strong as their counterparts. Additionally, we've reduced the duration of
  Feast on Fear, but increased its healing per tick, so Diablo players can get
  more value out of a few healing ticks before overriding it.</p>

<p><strong>MVP Screen</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players can no longer vote for themselves on the end of match awards screen.
<ul>
<li>This should help encourage players to spread the love by commending others for their epic plays!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The number of votes required to achieve epic and legendary commendations on the end of match awards screen have each been reduced by one vote.
<ul>
<li>This has been done to account for the removal of self-voting. Previously, a self-vote could often make the difference for a player who was one vote shy of reaching epic or legendary status.</li>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Loot Chest carousel on the Loot screen now automatically switches to a Loot Chest type the player already owns, rather than always defaulting to Rare Loot Chests.</li>

<ul>
<li>Previously, a Hero could display these visual effects even if their Movement Speed hadn't been significantly altered. This could occur as a result of multiple stacking Movement Speed bonuses and Slows, or due to a stacking Quest Talent.</li>

  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Development on Hanamura is still going smoothly.

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong>

<li>The Khazra at the southernmost Mercenary Camp on Infernal Shrines now move into lane once they are captured, rather than path around the lane to attack opposing structures directly.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The bonus damage dealt by Warheads had very little
  counterplay in late-game situations. Teams could hoard Warheads and kill any
  Structure—including the Core—very quickly. Although this center bonus damage
  presented players with interesting decision points, the mechanic's problems
  outweighed its positives. We feel encouraging players to hit as many
  structures as possible is a similarly fun mechanic that is healthier for the
  game.</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goals for Lunara's rework are twofold: first, we
  want to add some gameplay to Wisp and consolidate its related talents into
  something more interesting. We also want to give Lunara more potential
  playstyles, which we're doing by adding some new powerful talents into her
  tree. Because we added so much more power into her talents, we had to reduce
  her baseline power by a marginal amount to compensate. We've had a blast with
  Lunara in our internal playtests, and we're excited to release her new and
  improved version into the wild!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo's update aims to give the Lord of Terror more
  control over his kit and add fun new gameplay without compromising his core
  identity in the Nexus. We're putting the power in the hands of Diablo players
  by allowing them to target their Fire Stomps and allowing multiple fire waves
  to hit the same Hero to help execute the perfect combo. We're adding self-
  healing to Fire Stomp so that Diablo has a way to maintain his health beyond
  relying on a Support to heal him. Shadow Charge now grants increased Movement
  Speed to reduce situations where enemies are just beyond Overpower's reach
  after charging in. Diablo's level 4 Talents all allow him to collect souls in
  new ways, so he can still get the most out of his Trait during low takedown
  games. There is also a spiderweb of fun synergies and interactions between the
  Talents in his tree, so we're excited to see what creative combinations
  players will latch onto.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goals for Lunara's rework are twofold: first, we
  want to add some gameplay to Wisp and consolidate its related talents into
  something more interesting. We also want to give Lunara more potential
  playstyles, which we're doing by adding some new powerful talents into her
  tree. Because we added so much more power into her talents, we had to reduce
  her baseline power by a marginal amount to compensate. We've had a blast with
  Lunara in our internal playtests, and we're excited to release her new and
  improved version into the wild!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo's update aims to give the Lord of Terror more
  control over his kit and add fun new gameplay without compromising his core
  identity in the Nexus. We're putting the power in the hands of Diablo players
  by allowing them to target their Fire Stomps and allowing multiple fire waves
  to hit the same Hero to help execute the perfect combo. We're adding self-
  healing to Fire Stomp so that Diablo has a way to maintain his health beyond
  relying on a Support to heal him. Shadow Charge now grants increased Movement
  Speed to reduce situations where enemies are just beyond Overpower's reach
  after charging in. Diablo's level 4 Talents all allow him to collect souls in
  new ways, so he can still get the most out of his Trait during low takedown
  games. There is also a spiderweb of fun synergies and interactions between the
  Talents in his tree, so we're excited to see what creative combinations
  players will latch onto.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our resident warlock has been in and out of the meta
  a couple times since his epic release and his Talent tree has become a bit
  lopsided. We began these changes by looking at Rain of Destruction (even going
  as far as testing the Ability without a channel!) but quickly realized that we
  would need more than just a balance patch to appropriately address the Heroic.
  We were, however, able to make some Talent adjustments that will hopefully
  give players fun new ways to drain the life from their opponents!</p>

<li>Area of effect damage reduced from 100% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes require Hanzo to put himself at greater
  risk to deal the considerable amount of damage that he can dish out over the
  course of a game. While we believe Hanzo has a unique place as an Assassin who
  specializes in using his superior range to kite enemies, he was able to do so
  too safely, which was crowding out other ranged Assassins.</p>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking passes at some older Talent trees that,
  while not in need of a full rework, could use some design tweaks. The changes
  to Kael'thas in particular went through quite a bit of iteration. We're happy
  to report that, unlike some of the insane Talents we tried internally, we
  managed to re-imagine and restore the power of Ignite!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Ana is showing a positive win rate, we're still
  not seeing her picked up in the solo-Support position as often as we'd like.
  These changes should allow her to stick around longer in fights and limit wear
  and tear on your Hearthstone hotkey.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deckard's foray into the Nexus has been incredibly
  successful from a balance perspective. He's sitting at a healthy win rate of
  anywhere between 47% and 51% in high level play, depending on the experience
  of the Deckard player. Many of his Talents are also looking to be in good
  shape. We're making some tuning changes intended to adjust under and
  overperforming Talents without impacting his overall win rate too much.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are meant to make the immediate
  aftermath of being thrown by Wrecking Ball a little less punishing for
  Garrosh's opponents, particularly when he throws an enemy Hero and then Stuns
  them with Groundbreaker. We're slightly reducing Groundbreaker's Stun duration
  so that enemy Heroes can more quickly pop defensive cooldowns to try to
  survive. We're also compensating Garrosh with a slight increase to
  Groundbreaker's Slow. This way, he can still reliably catch enemies if he
  starts with Groundbreaker and wants to close in for a throw.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Battle Rage is proving to be the dominant pick on its
  Talent tier and provides a lot of generic power to Sonya's kit. Rather than
  nerf it, we're placing it against stronger Talents at Level 7 to lessen the
  amount of generic power she can get overall. Similarly, Mystical Spear at 13
  is giving a bit too much raw power in addition to its utility. It should now
  be more in-line with the more situational Talents at that tier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We believe the Warhead Junction boss is a cool
  variant of the standard golem boss found on most maps, but it had some
  inconsistencies that needed addressing. These changes essentially make the
  boss a better version of itself—its neutral and captured versions are closer
  in power, and its Slime Pods create a cooler moment than its Podlings did
  previously.</span></p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re making some changes to Genji to try and make
  him less frustrating to play against and give opponents more options with
  which to counter him. While we think resetting Swift Strike’s cooldown after
  killing enemy Heroes with Dragonblade made for cool, flashy plays, it shut
  down too many other Heroes too often. It also caused too many games to become
  about how much value Genji was able to get out of Dragonblade and little else.
  We like the flashiness that Dragonblade resets can provide, so we’re keeping
  that functionality, but we’re now adding it to his Level 20 Storm Talent
  version of the Heroic. We’re also increasing his Health and Basic Attack
  damage, reducing the range of Swift Strike, and increasing the cooldown of
  Cyber Agility to reduce his mobility while boosting his base stats to
  compensate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re making some changes to Genji to try and make
  him less frustrating to play against and give opponents more options to
  counter him. While we think resetting Swift Strike’s cooldown after killing
  enemy Heroes with Dragonblade made for cool, flashy plays, it shut down too
  many other Heroes too often. It also caused too many games to become about how
  much value Genji was able to get out of Dragonblade. We like the flashiness
  that Dragonblade resets can provide, so we’re keeping that functionality, but
  we’re now adding it to his Level 20 Storm Talent version of the Heroic. We’re
  also increasing his Health and Basic Attack damage, reducing the range of
  Swift Strike, and increasing the cooldown of Cyber Agility to reduce his
  mobility while boosting his base stats to compensate.</p>
