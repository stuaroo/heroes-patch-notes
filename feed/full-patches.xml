<ul>
<li><strong>Triglav Protector</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health increased from 10450 to 11500.</li>
<li>Health scaling in minutes 1-5 increased from 550 to 575.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since our last round of changes, game times have gone
  up on Volskaya Foundry a little more than we would like. We're buffing the
  Triglav Protector's pushing power so that it can get more damage done when
  it's taken.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jet Propulsion [E]
<ul>
<li>Delay before charging reduced from .5 to .375 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown increased from 8 to 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost increased from 40 to 45.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To help Blaze be a better front line for his team,
  we're slightly reducing the delay on Jet Propulsion to make it more reliable,
  and increasing its cooldown to compensate.</p>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eternal Flames [W]
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Also refunds 35 Mana when Stunning enemy Heroes with Shadow Charge or Overpower.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Diabolical Momentum [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1 to 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the order of talents to match other heroes (Q, W, E, etc.).</li>
<li>Devastating Charge [Q]
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus reduced from 80% to 50%.</li>
<li>Adjusted functionality: 
<ul>
<li>Quest: Hit 5 enemy Heroes against terrain with Shadow Charge.</li>
<li>Reward: Hitting enemy Heroes against terrain with Shadow Charge reduces their Armor by 15 for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hellfire [W]
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: When at maximum stacks, Diablo deals 15 damage to nearby enemies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've had a lot of discussion recently on Diablo's
  place in the meta and what makes him such a consistently popular pick, despite
  having a low win rate. We love the hero, and believe he's an incredibly fun
  Warrior to play, but we've heard complaints from players about his burst
  potential, and we agree that it can be a bit much to be killed in a double
  Shadow Charge combo post 16. To help free up other options on his 13 and 16
  tiers and to address issues with his burst, we are changing Devastating Charge
  to be a little less about his own burst damage, and more about debuffing his
  target so that his team can take advantage of his powerful initiation. In
  addition, we're buffing up his other builds so that they can be more viable
  compared to the double wall-stun combo that currently dominates his late-game
  playstyle. We hope that these changes still retain the fun of lining up the
  perfect Domination combo for those who love the playstyle while also bringing
  other ways to play him into the forefront.</p>

<h4 id="johanna">Johanna</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reinforce [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Physical Armor amount reduced from 75 to 50.</li>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Casting a Basic Ability gives Johanna 60 Physical Armor for 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Reinforce has been a bit of an awkward talent
  compared to others on the tier. Instead of giving Johanna charges of Block,
  we're changing it to give her Physical Armor for a duration. This should give
  Johanna the option to space her Abilities out to maximize the duration of the
  bonus.</p>

<li>Combo Strikes [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Attack Speed bonus reduced from 50% to 35%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now that Chen's rework has had some time to settle,
  we're doing some larger talent tuning due to a few talents outperforming
  others. Eye of the Tiger and Combo Strikes in particular are too powerful
  compared to other options, and his Stagger-related talents are
  underperforming. These tuning changes should better round out his talent
  options while still ensuring that he remain a viable member of the team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Outside of normal talent tuning changes, we wanted to
  move Celestial Attunement to a later talent tier. While it wasn't unreasonably
  blowing out games from a win rate perspective, we feel that it comes online
  too early for its powerful effect due to how it can make many other Heroes
  significantly less effective and fun to play for too much of a match. We like
  that it's a unique reason to bring Tyrande, but, similar to Kharazim's
  Cleansing Touch, we think it's more appropriate for these kinds of effects to
  come online later in the game.</p>

  quite a bit more powerful than intended. We're making these changes in the

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Darkness Within has always been a bit of an outlier
  compared to Gul'dan's other talents at 16. We're trying something new with
  this iteration, which is now about keeping a rolling Spell Power buff going by
  continuing to deal damage to enemy Heroes and, if Gul'dan can do this, having
  a better engine to fuel his abilities. We're hoping that this makes Darkness
  Within a powerful and different feeling option compared to the other talents

<p>A sworn knight and holder of a singularity shard, Qhira's only desire is to
seek out others who may have escaped the destruction of her doomed home realm,
Iresia. While she searches, she gets by as a bounty hunter--- a job she
loathes, despite her exceptional skill.</p>

<p><strong>Trait</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Grappling Hook [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Qhira fires a Grappling Hook that pulls her to any terrain it contacts. If an enemy Hero is hit, they take 36 damage and Qhira launches at them, dealing an additional 112 damage on impact. Can be used while Revolving Sweep is active.

<li>Cooldown: 6 seconds</li>

<li>​​<strong>Blood Rage [W]</strong>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Revolving Sweep [E]</strong>
<ul>

Once attached, Qhira becomes immune to all effects, swinging around the target for 2.75 seconds, and dealing 109 damage to any enemies between you and the target. Reactivate to send you to the target's location, knocking them back, dealing 112 damage and Stunning them for .75 seconds.
<ul>

  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>[NEW] Dev Comment:</strong></em> Due to player feedback about their favorite
  Battleground being removed or least favorite added, and also us questioning
  the value that we were gaining by having a Battleground rotation, we've
  decided to get our Storm League pool to 11 Battlegrounds and probably leave it
  there for the immediate future. The original idea behind a rotation was to
  facilitate a different metagame and make the game feel fresh and different,
  but we found that this wasn't really panning out this way and in fact created
  more confusion and volatility than enjoyment. We still think that altering the
  game from season to season is important to keep things feeling fresh, and
  we'll be exploring ways to do this beyond our regular Hero updates and new
  Heroes in the future.</span></p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've made some changes to Braxis to even out the
  power curve of Zerg waves and introduce what we've found is a fun new mechanic
  in Drop Pods. By causing reinforcements of Zerg to periodically appear via
  Drop Pods, it makes some effects like Planet Cracker and Lava Wave a little
  less powerful against them. It also provides a stronger focus for single
  target characters, as removing Ultralisks and Guardians earlier will cause
  fewer Drop Pods to spawn, thereby indirectly helping against the massive zerg
  onslaught. The tuning changes get the zerg in line with most of our other
  Mercenaries and Minions, which mostly mirror a Hero's power level over the
  course of a game (though Battleground events tend to get more deadly in the
  late game to force a conclusion to matches). Overall, we think you'll enjoy
  these small changes to Braxis. It won't greatly change the way the
  Battleground feels but introduce a little freshness to the map while helping
  balance a few longstanding issues with over the top Hero imbalances on the
  Battleground.</p>

<h3 id="new-hero-qhira-iresian-bounty-hunter">New Hero: Qhira, Iresian Bounty Hunter</h3>

<p>A sworn knight and holder of a singularity shard, Qhira's only desire is to
seek out others who may have escaped the destruction of her doomed home realm,
Iresia. While she searches, she gets by as a bounty hunter--- a job she
loathes, despite her exceptional skill.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trait</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grappling Hook (D)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Qhira fires a Grappling Hook that pulls her to any terrain it contacts. If an enemy Hero is hit, they take 36 damage and Qhira launches at them, dealing an additional 112 damage on impact. Can be used while Revolving Sweep is active.
<ul>
<li>Cooldown: 25 Seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Cost: 40 Mana</li>
<li>Cooldown: 6 seconds</li>

</ul></li>
<li>​​<strong>Blood Rage [W]</strong>

<li>​Passive: Basic Attack and Ability damage cause enemies to bleed for 46 damage over 4 seconds. Stacks 5 times.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cost: 35 Mana</li>
<li>Cooldown: 8 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Revolving Sweep [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>​Attach your sword to the first enemy Hero hit, Stunning them for .25 seconds. Once attached, Qhira becomes immune to all effects, swinging around the target for 2.75 seconds, and dealing 109 damage to any enemies between you and the target. Reactivate to send you to the target's location, knocking them back, dealing 112 damage and Stunning them for .75 seconds.
<ul>
<li>Cost: 70 Mana</li>
<li>Cooldown: 16 Seconds</li>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes and bug
fixes! Read on for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Movement Speed Increase</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increase the base movement speed of Heroes from 4.4 to 4.84 (+10%)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We were evaluating this change last year for the gameplay updates but wanted some more time to soak it. While this is a modest increase, we feel like it makes the game feel a bit snappier, especially while in combat. We will be carefully watching how this affects Heroes with lots of skillshots and will balance as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Each Mecha Tyrael's repeatable Mission can now only be completed up to 50 times</li>
<li>Gem purchasing has a new checkout interface. This streamlined system gives players access to more payment options from directly within the client</li>

<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 1.25 seconds to 1 second</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak is still slightly too powerful and popular
  compared to other Warriors, so we're making some more adjustments to his
  overall power level to bring him in line. In the past, we reduced Harden
  Carapace's cooldown soon after changing the Ability to provide significant
  Spell Armor, which greatly increased Anuba'rak's overall survivability. We're
  pulling back on that change now which should help other Warriors better
  compete with him.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> ETC is the Warrior with the highest win-rate in the
  game, and his popularity has seen a spike since our last balance patch. To get
  ahead of any issues, we're slightly nerfing Guitar Solo's cooldown and buffing
  Guitar Hero to compensate for the nerf.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're slightly buffing Mal'ganis's base kit to make
  him a little more competitive with other Warriors. Since so much of his power
  is tied to Fel Claws, even 1 second off of its cooldown should be a meaningful
  boon to his ability to engage, disengage, and CC opponents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite Brewmaster has made a big splash in the
  Nexus. We've read the feedback that players want the interaction between Keg
  Smash and Breath of Fire to be more fluid, so we're reducing the delay between
  the two abilities, which should make them feel better to play with as people
  get used to his new cadence. We're also buffing many of Chen's talents,
  particularly those that are related to his survivability, which should help
  him stay in fights longer.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We gave Yrel some buffs not too long ago, and we're

  monster when she gets going, so we're incrementally increasing her power so
  that she doesn't go out of control. She can now cast Hand of Freedom on
  herself, which should make the talent much less situational. With this round
  of buffs, we are looking at bringing up her mid-late game power so that she
  has a more meaningful power spike as the game goes on and her enemies gain
  more options to deal with her.</p>

  tried to nerf various Cleave talents in the past to promote other playstyles,
  but it has not yielded effective-enough results. We believe that the main
  culprit is the power of Wormhole giving Zeratul too much control over dealing
  damage incredibly quickly with Cleave before enemies can respond. With this
  change, Zeratul will have to commit for a little over 1 second to where he
  teleports to before being able to return to his starting location, which
  should give opponents who are paying attention to him time to punish him for
  mistakes. In addition to this change, we're buffing some of Zeratul's

<h3 id="mechastorm-ii">MechaStorm II</h3>

<p>Xenotech threatens the planet once again. This new invasion is being led by
Mecha Malthael, sowing havoc and destruction across Neo-Stormwind. Many
outposts and cities have already felt the wrath of the Mecha Archangel of
Death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new generation of Heroes arise to defend the innocent. Equipped with cutting
edge Mecha technology provided by Neo-President Anduin, the young pilots
prepare for the battles ahead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must stand together alongside Valla and Yrel as members of the MechaStorm
to help bring Xenotech's Mecha Malthael's advance to a halt. However, you must
first make sure your equipment is up to the task.</p>

<h3 id="mechastorm-ii-quest-chain">MechaStorm II Quest Chain</h3>

<p>Repair, upgrade and run repeatable combat simulation missions for each part of
Mecha Tyrael. Join the Neo-Stormwind's mobile Mecha squadron alongside Valla
and Yrel to help push back the Xenotech invasion being led by Mecha Malthael.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earn Mecha-themed sprays, portraits and loot boxes while working to unlock
Tyrael the Hero as well as the unique Perfect Mecha Tyrael skin.</p>

<h3 id="mechastorm-ii-loot-chests">MechaStorm II Loot Chests</h3>

<p>From June 17th to August 5th, your main goal will be working to thwart the
Xenotech invasion. During this time all Loot Chests earned or bought with Gold
will be Mechastorm II Loot Chests (excluding Hero-specific ones). These Loot
Chests guarantee at least one item from either MechaStorm II or previous
years' Summer Events.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become MechaStorm II Loot Chests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Ranked Season naming convention has been changed. We are changing the naming convention to be a numbers and year string instead. </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the 1st season ending in 2019 the string would be "2019 Season 1"</li>
<li>Storm League Preseason would be "2019 Season 2"</li>
<li>Storm League initial season would be "2019 Season 3"</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The new Chen has finally arrived! We had a blast tinkering with him, and look forward to seeing him unleashed to his full potential in your hands. When taking a look at how to best change him, we primarily focused on adding more opportunities for Chen to make plays and for his opponents to interact with him. Some of his power has been taken out of Fortifying Brew and put into his new ability, Stagger, as well as into his talents. While he may take a bit of time to master, proper management of Chen's cooldowns should result in a formidable hero that will make a great addition to any team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The new Chen has finally arrived! We had a blast tinkering with him, and look forward to seeing him unleashed to his full potential in your hands. When taking a look at how to best change him, we primarily focused on adding more opportunities for Chen to make plays and for his opponents to interact with him. Some of his power has been taken out of Fortifying Brew and put into his new ability, Stagger, as well as into his talents. While he may take a bit of time to master, proper management of Chen's cooldowns should result in a formidable hero that will make a great addition to any team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak is still overperforming compared to other
  Warriors, so this time we are reducing the power of Legion of Beetles and
  Cocoon, which are still stand out talents for him. We are hesitant to over-
  nerf him, so our strategy going forward is to combine these smaller nerfs with
  buffs to other Warriors to create a healthier meta for the role.</p>

<ul>
<li>Damage reduction increased from 20% to 25%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Garrosh is incredibly popular due to his
  ability to heavily displace enemy Heroes, he is not outperforming other Heroes
  in the game, sitting at a 48% win rate at higher levels of play in the hands
  of people who are skilled with him specifically. At lower levels of play his
  win rate drops to 47.2%, where he wins the award for being the second lowest
  win-rate Warrior in the game. We're slightly nerfing Wrecking Ball's cooldown
  to help address his high popularity and frustrations playing against him, and
  buffing some of his under-picked talents to better compete with their peers to
  help stabilize his talent tree.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To make it more consistent with other damage
  modifiers, we are changing Consuming Flame's bonus from a flat amount to a
  percent bonus, which will make it scale with Imperius's level. This is a
  slight nerf to his Level 1 damage, but overall a fairly significant buff to
  the talent during the middle and later portions of the game. To make Flash of
  Anger more reliable, we are changing its functionality to be about consuming
  marks of Celestial Charge instead of trying to hit enemy Heroes first with
  Solarion's Fire. To compensate for the power and reliability bonuses we're
  giving, we are reverting the damage bonus that we gave to the talent last
  patch. This functionality change should make the use case for the talent much
  more clear: Impale enemies, gain benefits.</p>

  do though is buff up a lot of the lesser chosen Talents on him so that he
  feels like he has a greater variety of options. We're also looking to make
  Bold Strategy a little more bold, and a little less automatic. We're aiming to
  do this by reducing his higher than typical Mana tension baseline (which Bold
  Strategy helped alleviated by increasing Flash Heal's cooldown and making his
  healing more efficient), while also increasing the cooldown penalty for Bold
  Strategy. This is in addition to buffing up the other two Talents on the tier,
  which also buffs Bold Strategy. Net result is that Pursued by Grace and Renew
  will give Anduin a little more consistent healing, and potentially open up
  synergy with the significantly buffed Binding Heal at level 7.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some quality of life changes to some of

  Switch would often be lower than the cooldowns of his Healing Pathogen and
  Weighted Pustule, which made part of its benefit meaningless. This change
  should make its 5-second cooldown more important, as he can use his other

  of stacks, and an obvious way to nerf it would be to cap its stacks, a large
  part of the enjoyment of playing Alarak and of taking talents like Negatively
  Charged is about living the dream when playing well. We are instead going to

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rain of Destruction has not been the predominant
  Heroic since Gul'dan's release. We believe there are two reasons for this: the
  first being that it has some randomness to its output in regards to where the
  meteors land, and the second being that it requires Gul'dan to channel for 7
  seconds, which gives his opponents an incredibly long time to interrupt him
  while also not allowing him to use his other abilities or provide any other
  output during that time. We're targeting the second issue with this change,
  which will allow Gul'dan to gain the ability to move and use his abilities
  while the Rain of Destruction is happening. We may in the future look at the
  randomness of the Heroic's meteors, but at this time we want to try this
  change as it retains most of the original fantasy of Gul'dan raining Hellfire
  upon his enemies. We're also improving some of Gul'dan's lesser picked
  talents. We realize that he has some fundamental issues with Corruption
  focused talents dominating his talent tree, and are looking at exploring ways
  in the future to make alternative ways to play more meaningfully competitive.</p>

<li>The gate near each team's Summoner Mercenary Camp now has two Towers on either side of it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've added Towers near each team's central Healing Well to prevent certain Heroes from being able to destroy them too easily</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Dragon Shire</p>

<ul>
<li>Dragon Shire has received a significant update to its art</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Infernal Shrines</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-tuned the damage across all three Punisher types to bring them closer in parity
<ul>
<li>Arcane Punisher
<ul>
<li>Arcane damage increased from 52 to 53</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are designed to bring the 3 types of Punishers more closely aligned in power, while preserving what makes them special. Mortar is now a properly scary amount of damage up front, while Arcane had its damage reduced but maintains the highest damage over a long period of time. Frozen has had structure disabled added to it, further encouraging teams to dive into enemy towns alongside him.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making these changes to the Triglav Protector to shift a little of the vehicles power out of its team fight potential, and into its pushing power (particularly in the early game). We believe that it has to have some teeth to discourage enemies from committing to a team fight when it pushes, but its capability to nuke someone from almost full health was a little too powerful. We've changed Rocket Fist's root into a knockback to make landing all its abilities more difficult as well, but still force enemies to disengage when it connects. We've also taken this time to adjust some of the scaling of the Protector, so that it follows a more typical power curve in relation to Heroes, Minions, and Mercenaries. We've removed the Swap Vehicle button as well. While it was cool, it was a hold out from the previous undesired gameplay of a solo player controlling both seats of a vehicle that we discouraged via the Spell Power buff to both seats being occupied.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes and bug
fixes! Read on for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>The party size of enemies will no longer be shown during the match loading screen</li>
<li>Removed all party-size restrictions during the matchmaking process</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes should help address both queue times
  for certain party sizes while also removing the pre-game bias that forms when
  facing parties of players that may be larger than your own. In order to ensure
  fair matches are created, one of the variables used to determine whether a
  match has an acceptable win probability is the party size. In the event the
  party sizes across both teams aren't equal ([5]vs[1-1-1-1-1] for example),
  other variables will be weighted differently to make sure the match created is
  balanced. One example of this is that a team of [5] may have a lower MMR vs a
  team of [1-1-1-1-1] to help balance out the advantage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As we promised in the past, we took a look at the
  overall Mana tension of all the Heroes in the game. We also have some
  philosophies about Mana that we want to keep going forward. They are:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Mana should be a meaningful part of the game, particularly in the early
  stages when wave clear is at a higher premium. We believe that as the game
  progresses, Mana tension should become less important as Heroes gain more base
  Mana and the game's focus shifts to team fighting.</p></li>
  <li><p>Mana tension doesn't have to be the same for every Hero, but every Hero
  should feel it to some degree, otherwise it serves no purpose.</p></li>
  <li><p>We like that some talents heavily mitigate Mana tension.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>When we took a look at Mana tension in the game, we saw that, overall,
  things are in a fairly healthy spot, but could be fine-tuned and improved
  upon. We like the tension that the heroes who are closer to the middle of the
  spectrum have, with some examples being Malfurion, Tychus, and E.T.C. Our goal
  with these changes is to bring the outliers closer to the center. We are open
  to your feedback going forward if you think that the game needs to be stricter
  or more lenient in this area, or if you believe there are any outliers that we
  missed.</p>

  Hunger or Frozen Wastes, but we feel that he is currently too dependent on

  <p>Our reasoning behind this change is that we want to make Tormented Souls

  simply add power to the Heroic. Instead, we are giving Malthael the ability to

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> An unintended side-effect of buffing the damage of
  Misha, Charge! to be much more meaningful was its interaction with Easy Prey.
  We intend Easy Prey to be the better talent when taking Mercenary Camps, while
  having a smaller effect of buffing Rexxar's general wave clear. When this
  talent also becomes the best Wave Clear option, it encroaches too much on Bird
  of Prey's design space, so we're removing that functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've gotten feedback from players that they missed
  the old Quick Mind talent that existed before Alarak's rework, as it allowed
  them to use Telekinesis in more creative ways since they felt more free to
  cast the ability when it was on a shorter cooldown. We agree, and we're using
  the Ruthless Momentum talent to allow this to happen. Instead of reducing all
  of Alarak's cooldowns, we're instead specializing the talent to greatly reduce
  the cooldown of Telekinesis. This should allow players who pick this talent to
  reposition themselves, peel for their allies, or fish for initiations on the
  enemy more often.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To promote some build diversity away from Globe of
  Annihilation, we're moving around some of Azmodan's Mana costs. We are
  increasing the Mana cost of Globe of Annihilation, but reducing it from Summon
  Demon Warrior and All Shall Burn. This should make Azmodan think a little more
  in the early game about casting optimal Globes to stack properly, while
  leaving him freer to use his other abilities when necessary. In the later
  parts of the game, this should also be a buff to other non-Q centric talents
  like Hell Rift and Sin's Grasp.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're pretty happy with how Chromie's rework is
  playing, though there is a small amount of space to buff her up overall (even
  with the understanding that her winrate will go up as players get used to her
  new playstyle). We're trying to give a small buff to her base kit, while also
  balancing out a few of the Talent tiers. In particular, we're changing
  Blessing of the Bronze to be an activated ability, so that opponents have
  greater counterplay. Chromie (and the community) saw this one coming, so we
  were ready to pull the trigger quickly on this change.</p>

<ul>
<li>The cap on maximum negative Armor has been increased from -25 to -75, now that different Armor effects no longer stack. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The negative Armor cap was originally instituted as a
  safety precaution so that stacking long term negative Armor effects wouldn't
  lead to degenerate gameplay. We don't anticipate many effects to go beyond
  -25, but there are a few cases where this can happen (including the new
  Unraveling Talent on Chromie and Sgt. Hammer's Shrapnel Mines).</p>

<h3 id="new-event">New Event</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Caldeum Complex</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome to the Caldeum Acropolis, 2103 AD. A city bought and sold a hundred
times over, now giant Mega Corporations hold more sway in the ever-shifting
politics of the world than governments. Down on the rain slicked streets,
humans, mutants, machines and synthetics all struggle to find their place in
the light of the neon glow beneath the towering monuments to capitalism
lording over them.</p>

<p>With such oppression, the common people often turn to a life of crime. The
leader of one of the largest gangs, the Azure Dragons, goes by the nickname,
<strong>Chromie.</strong> Both a hacker and an anti-corporate street artist, many have said
her work has an almost prophetic quality, as if she sees through time itself.
The corporate media would have you believe she uses her gang of hackers to
illegally ensure her prophecies become true, but lately her work has turned
dark, as if she's seen a cataclysmic force on the horizon…</p>

<p>Recently, the Dragons have found an ally in the Onyx Turtles. While it's rare
to see the gangs working together, as the noose of systemic oppression has
grown tighter, those in the underbelly of the mega-city have had to find new
ways to survive. <strong>Kharazim</strong> and his Turtles are a harder sort of stock than
most, with many known gladiators and street fighters serving in the ranks.
This new alliance has provided the Azure Dragons a strong defense against
threats in the physical world.</p>

<p>High above, the Jigoku Cybernetics Corporation, a primary manufacturer of
mechanical augmentations, has become a target of both groups. In the mean
streets, human enhancement has become one of the few options left to move the
playing field more into the favor of those willing to bend the law. But their
efforts have not gone unnoticed, and any who would dare to impugn the honor of
Jigoku find themselves in the sights of the CyberOni, Jigoku's elite agents:
merciless killers at the beck and call of their bureaucratic masters.</p>

<li><strong>Caldeum Complex Loot Chests</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Starting the week of March 26, all Loot chests earned through progression
(except Hero-specific Chests), Heroes Brawl, or by spending Gold will be
Caldeum Complex Loot Chests. These loot chests guarantee at least one item
from the Caldeum Complex or previous years' Lunar New Year Spring events.
Carve out your place among the infamous gangs and score yourself some sweet
loot before the streets calm on April 30!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will <strong>not</strong> become Caldeum Complex Loot Chests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lúcio's rework is unlocking some new ways to help
  your allies and further harass your enemies! His old Trait, Wall Ride, is
  still completely functional but has been moved to his Mount (Z). The
  replacement Trait, Push Off, is a new utility Ability that gives Lúcio more
  mobility with a built-in way to peel enemies for his allies. That is just the
  beginning, though, as Lúcio has also gained a new Heroic Ability—High Five.
  This Ability allows him a small bit of burst healing to help compete with
  Sound Barrier while also granting an on-demand Unstoppable buff to allies that
  may have bitten off more than they can chew. If you were a big fan of Reverse
  Amp, no need to worry, it stays on his kit in the form of a talent and has
  similar functionality! In response to the added power, we are slowing him down
  a little so he is not quite as frustrating to lock down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goal with this Chromie update is to create
  various degrees of success that Chromie can enjoy, so that she doesn't feel
  like quite the same all-or-nothing mage that she's historically been.
  Traditionally, Chromie has often required a hard counter to keep her in check
  or completely wrecked an opposing team, creating polarizing experiences. We're
  instituting a lot of changes that allow Chromie to get partial success with
  her Abilities (multiple Sand Blasts baseline, 3 blasts of Dragon's Breath),
  while also widening her toolkit (friendly Stasis, Basic Attack damage, PvE
  damage). While we're diversifying her kit, we also want to make sure that
  Chromie feels special, and we think that her Sand Echoes and predictive
  gameplay with Dragon's Breath are still unique parts of her that embody the
  feeling of artillery mage while still having moments of counter play for
  opponents.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Due to Lunara's unique Movement Speed mechanics, our
  recent update to Blossom Swell was not as beneficial to Lunara as we had
  hoped. To address this, we are slightly reducing its bonus but allowing it to
  stack with other Movement Speed bonuses, including Lunara's trait, which
  should dramatically increase the total Movement Speed that she gets from this
  talent.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>The cap on maximum negative Armor has been increased from -25 to -75, now that different Armor effects no longer stack 
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The negative Armor cap was originally instituted as a safety precaution so that stacking long term negative Armor effects wouldn't lead to degenerate gameplay. We don't anticipate many effects to go beyond -25, but there are a few cases where this can happen (including the new Unraveling Talent on Chromie and Sgt. Hammer's Shrapnel Mines).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hero Roles Update 
<ul>
<li>Updated roles include: Tank, Bruiser, Support, Healer, Melee Assassin, and Ranged Assassin</li>
<li>For more information, please review our blog <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/">here</a></li>

<h3 id="new-event-caldeum-complex">New Event: Caldeum Complex</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Caldeum Arcopolis, 2103 AD. A city bought and sold a hundred
times over, now giant Mega Corporations hold more sway in the ever-shifting
politics of the world than governments. Down on the rain slicked streets,
humans, mutants, machines and synthetics all struggle to find their place in
the light of the neon glow beneath the towering monuments to capitalism
lording over them.</p>

<p>With such oppression, the common people often turn to a life of crime. The
leader of one of the largest gangs, the Azure Dragons, goes by the nickname,
<strong>Chromie.</strong> Both a hacker and an anti-corporate street artist, many have said
her work has an almost prophetic quality, as if she sees through time itself.
The corporate media would have you believe she uses her gang of hackers to
illegally ensure her prophecies become true, but lately her work has turned
dark, as if she's seen a cataclysmic force on the horizon…</p>

<p>Recently, the Dragons have found an ally in the Onyx Turtles. While it's rare
to see the gangs working together, as the noose of systemic oppression has
grown tighter, those in the underbelly of the mega-city have had to find new
ways to survive. <strong>Kharazim</strong> and his Turtles are a harder sort of stock than
most, with many known gladiators and street fighters serving in the ranks.
This new alliance has provided the Azure dragons a strong defense against
threats in the physical world.</p>

<p>High above, the Jigoku Cybenetics Corporation, a primary manufacturer of
mechanical augmentations, has become a target of both groups. In the mean
streets, human enhancement has become one of the few options left to move the
playing field more into the favor of those willing to bend the law. But their
efforts have not gone unnoticed, and any who would dare to impugn the honor of
Jigoku find themselves in the sights of the CyberOni, Jigoku's elite agents:
merciless killers at the beck and call of their bureaucratic masters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lúcio's rework is unlocking some new ways to help your allies and further harass your enemies! His old Trait, Wall Ride, is still completely functional but has been moved to his Mount (Z). The replacement Trait, Push Off, is a new utility Ability that gives Lúcio more mobility with a built-in way to peel enemies for his allies.</p>
  
  <p>That is just the beginning, though, as Lúcio has also gained a new Heroic
  Ability—High Five. This Ability allows him a small bit of burst healing to
  help compete with Sound Barrier while also granting an on-demand Unstoppable
  buff to allies that may have bitten off more than they can chew. If you were a
  big fan of Reverse Amp, no need to worry, it stays on his kit in the form of a
  talent and has similar functionality! In response to the added power, we are
  slowing him down a little so he is not quite as frustrating to lock down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goal with this Chromie update is to create various degrees of success that Chromie can enjoy, so that she doesn't feel like quite the same all-or-nothing mage that she's historically been. Traditionally, Chromie has often required a hard counter to keep her in check or completely wrecked an opposing team, creating polarizing experiences.</p>
  
  <p>We're instituting a lot of changes that allow Chromie to get partial success
  with her Abilities (multiple Sand Blasts baseline, 3 blasts of Dragon's
  Breath), while also widening her toolkit (friendly Stasis, Basic Attack
  damage, PvE damage). While we're diversifying her kit, we also want to make
  sure that Chromie feels special, and we think that her Sand Echoes and
  predictive gameplay with Dragon's Breath are still unique parts of her that
  embody the feeling of artillery mage while still having moments of counter
  play for opponents.</p>

<h4 id="lunara">Lunara</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blossom Swell (Q) 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed bonus reduced from 15% to 12%</li>
<li>This Movement Speed bonus now stacks with other Movement Speed bonuses</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Due to Lunara's unique Movement Speed mechanics, our recent update to Blossom Swell was not as beneficial to Lunara as we had hoped. To address this, we are slightly reducing its bonus but allowing it to stack with other Movement Speed bonuses, including Lunara's trait, which should dramatically increase the total Movement Speed that she gets from this talent.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blade of the Highlord (Trait)
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes grant 2% Sadism, up to 30%. Sadism gained from Blade of the Highlord is lost on death</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since its inception, Blade of the Highlord has not
  performed well compared to the other talents on its tier. With this change,
  we're hoping to bring it to a more competitive space by making its bonuses
  more permanent instead of only lasting for a small window of time.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zei's Vengeance (W)
<ul>
<li>Arcane Orb cooldown reduction reduced from 2 to 1 second
<ul>
<li>This should increase the total cooldown reduction of an Arcane Orb hitting with the Triumvirate proc from 5 seconds to 6 seconds when Triumvirate and Zei's Vengeance are both taken</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Hitting an enemy Hero with Noxious Blossom increases Lunara's Movement Speed by 15% for 3 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Blossom Swell has been underperforming compared to
  other talents on its tier since Lunara's last rework. While her talent
  diversity is fairly good compared to other heroes in the game, we want to give
  her Q build some love, and saw this as an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mind Devourer (E)
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus reduced from 5 to 4 per stack</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Orphea has been performing very well as of late, with
  Mind Devourer in particular overshadowing other talents on its tier. We're
  slightly reducing its power to reduce her overall effectiveness while
  hopefully motivating players to try out her other Level 7 talents more often.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="raynor">Raynor</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Raynor's Raider (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leash range increased from 12.5 to 14</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> There are many cases where due to the leash range of
  Raynor's Raider, it doesn't quite do what Raynor wants it to. To make it more
  consistently do what the player wants and expects, we're slightly increasing
  its leash range.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="samuro">Samuro</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Way of the Blade (W)
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Now also reduces the Physical Armor of enemy Heroes hit by Critical Strike by 10 for 2 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Way of the Wind (E)
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality:
<ul>
<li>Samuro's Critical Strikes reduce the cooldown of Windwalk by 1.5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's not too surprising that Way of Illusion has
  dominated Samuro's Level 1 tier since it adds the most direct teamfight power
  due to buffing his Basic Attack damage. Rather than nerf it further, we're
  looking to instead buff up its competing options, which should also add some
  synergies to his later talent tiers, and hopefully create more diversity on
  other tiers.</p>

<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Now also grants Tychus 1.5 Basic Attack range</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To make Bob and Weave feel more fun and powerful,

  Basic Attack range increase.</p>

<h4 id="azmodan">Azmodan</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Globe of Annihilation (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage scaling reduced from 3% to 2.5%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Greed (Q)
<ul>
<li>New functionality:
<ul>
<li>Globe of Annihilation deals 20% bonus damage to non-Heroic targets. Quest: After gaining 200 Annihilation, increase the range of All Shall Burn by 25%, and Demon Warriors gain 20% Movement Speed and Attack Speed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sin's Grasp (E)
<ul>
<li>New functionality:
<ul>
<li>All Shall Burn Slows enemies by 15% during its channel. If the channel finishes, increase this slow to 45% for 2 seconds, and reduce the cooldown of All Shall Burn by 50%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trample (Active)
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 60 to 20 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan is raining a bit too much destruction on the
  Nexus, so we're bringing his late-game power down a notch by reducing Globe of
  Annihilation's scaling damage. In addition, we saw an opportunity to help his
  talent pick rates by adjusting a couple existing talents, which will hopefully
  motivate more players to pursue builds that don't involve powering up Globe of
  Annihilation.</p>

<h4 id="medivh">Medivh</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Temporal Flux (Q)
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction changed from 1 second per Basic Attack and 3 seconds for Arcane Rift hits to 3% per Basic Attack and 9% per Arcane Rift hit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We like talents that lower Heroic cooldowns, but
  unfortunately many of the heroes who have these talents also have Heroics with
  wildly different cooldowns, which makes these talents hard to tune and pick in
  many cases. Because of this, we're standardizing these talents to reduce a
  percentage of each Heroic's cooldown so that players feel free to pick the
  talent regardless of which Heroic they chose earlier in the game.</p>

<h4 id="probius">Probius</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Null Gate (R)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Range increased from 8.5 to 9.5</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Null Gate is performing well in regards to win-
  rate compared to Pylon Overcharge, the Heroic is still not picked as much as
  we would like, and is much harder to use properly. Because of this, we're
  buffing its range to make it a little more usable, so that Probius players can
  more consistently get value out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="zagara">Zagara</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Baneling Massacre (Q)
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality:
<ul>
<li>Increase the damage of Banelings by 20%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Viscous Acid (Q)
<ul>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds</li>
<li>Slow amount increased from 20% to 25%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bile Drop (E)
<ul>
<li>Quest completion requirement reduced from 15 to 12</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Zagara's Level 7 talents have traditionally been very
  weak, and these changes are meant to make the tier feel more fun overall. If
  they blow her win-rate out of the water, we'll look at base kit nerfs to
  compensate.</p>

<li>Cooldown of Sleep Dart when a Hero is not woken up early changed from 6 seconds to 5 seconds</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're buffing up some of Ana's underperforming talents
  to make them more competitive with their counterparts. In addition, since we
  greatly increased its reliability, we're slightly increasing the cooldown of
  Eye of Horus to get ahead of potential frustration issues with a globally
  damaging Heroic being on such a low cooldown.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For how easy Li Li is to play, she is simply too

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've begun to take a look at some of Whitemane's
  underlying issues with Mana management, particularly in regards to how her
  talents interact with her base mechanics. We don't know how long this will
  take, and wanted to push out some small buffs to her to help her play and win
  rate in the meantime. When looking at her kit, we noticed that she had an
  abnormally high Basic Attack speed, combined with very low damage. We're
  reducing her Attack Speed, as she is not the kind of character that can turret
  on enemy Heroes like Tychus can, and we're buffing her damage to be much
  greater so that those attacks more meaningfully interact with Zeal. We're
  hoping that these small buffs better reward aggressive Whitemane players with
  both increased damage and healing output.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since our last round of nerfs, Cho'gall has fallen off
  a little more than we would like. In Cho's particular case, we feel that his
  survivability takes a particularly hard hit once the enemy team has access to
  Heroic abilities which are reliably able to shut him down. To help with this,
  we're moving his defensive talent tier from Level 16 to 13 in order to shorten
  the window of time that the enemy team has to take advantage of this
  particular weakness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo, while not winning outside of our normally

  enemy players have a larger window of time to take advantage of his
  threatening abilities being on cooldown.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since his rework, Ominous Wraith at Level 13 has
  largely defined Leoric's place on a team at more competitive levels of play.
  Rather than nerf something that we consider to be a fairly cool and unique
  playstyle, we're instead looking to buff up the other ways that players can
  build Leoric. Now all of his key build-around talents will be at Level 13,
  which should make his Basic Attack playstyle come online much sooner, and give
  him more options if he wants to build into Drain Hope, as he can now combine
  Unyielding Despair with Hardened Bones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since his inception, Rexxar has been one of the
  highest win-rate heroes in our game, never going below 50% at high levels of
  play. Despite this, we've heard consistent feedback that he doesn't feel as
  impactful as players would like. While we love that Rexxar depends heavily on
  his relationship with Misha to be effective, it also limits what we can do
  with him to make him feel powerful and fun to play. To help in this regard,
  we're moving a lot of his power out of the more automatic things that Misha
  does (mostly Basic attacking enemies), and into things that Rexxar himself is
  actively doing, such as using his Basic Attacks and commanding Misha to Stun
  enemies. Since we're buffing Misha, Charge so much, we're nerfing some of its
  associated talents as they are already highly picked by Rexxar players, and
  this change would otherwise be a dramatic buff to them.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's hard to create a competing talent to Nerves of

  in hopes that it competes more directly with Nerves of Steel while being

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Abathur has had a unique place in
  Heroes, being a powerful force at high level play while having a relatively
  low win-rate across the board. These changes are meant to spruce up his
  talents while streamlining his gameplay and introducing more counter-play to
  the hero. Carapace, particularly with the Sustained Carapace talent, created
  some awkward gameplay where it was much more efficient to use Symbiote on
  cooldown, even when the desire was to stay on one target, due to the cooldown
  refresh that it gave Carapace. In order to clean this up, Sustained Carapace
  is baseline and the cooldown of Carapace has been reduced, so Abathur no
  longer has to continuously remove Carapace to be efficient. In addition,
  Abathur's Locusts are now more potent, but they last for a shorter duration,
  meaning Abathur players will be more rewarded for positioning themselves
  aggressively and punished when they overextend too much.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Ana came to the Nexus during the ‘Quest Revolution'
  where we were adding them in as many places as we could. We have learned a lot

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Abathur has had a unique place in
  Heroes, being a powerful force at high level play while having a relatively
  low win-rate across the board. These changes are meant to spruce up his
  talents while streamlining his gameplay and introducing more counter-play to
  the hero. Carapace, particularly with the Sustained Carapace talent, created
  some awkward gameplay where it was much more efficient to use Symbiote on
  cooldown, even when the desire was to stay on one target, due to the cooldown
  refresh that it gave Carapace. In order to clean this up, Sustained Carapace
  is baseline and the cooldown of Carapace has been reduced, so Abathur no
  longer has to continuously remove Carapace to be efficient. In addition,
  Abathur's Locusts are now more potent, but they last for a shorter duration,
  meaning Abathur players will be more rewarded for positioning themselves
  aggressively and punished when they overextend too much.</p>

<li>Removed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak's Beetle Build has been a difficult sell,
  particularly at level 1, due to the power discrepancy of Resilient Scarabs
  compared to other talents on the tier. In order to help the build, we're
  reducing the opportunity cost of picking its talents by removing Resilient
  Scarabs and baking its functionality into Legion of Beetles. This should make
  for a much more attractive talent at level 1 against his other options, and
  should open up other build paths for players who like to slay their enemies
  with many tiny little friends. Anub'arak is a bit too strong overall right
  now, so we're reducing his damage so that he's not quite so dominant compared
  to the other tanks in our game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're pushing Chen towards more of a Bruiser role with
  these changes. One of the longstanding issues with Chen is that due to his
  trait functionality and tuning, he can either be shut down fairly easily or be
  too powerful depending on if the enemy team has the necessary CC and burst
  damage to deal with him. We're beginning to experiment with smoothing this out
  a but by increasing his sustained survivability and reducing the amount of
  burst he can tackle while also increasing his damage. While we are still
  iterating on him, we wanted to get some preliminary changes out sooner rather
  than hold back until we are finished.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Judging from data gained from more experienced
  Imperius players, our newest Hero will trend right into the sweet spot with
  his overall balance. We do want to make some tuning adjustments to a few of
  the Talents to make sure that they're all attractive choices however, which is
  what the majority of these balance changes aim to address.</p>
