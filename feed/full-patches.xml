<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are directed towards fixing some of

  Warden's Cage. We like that it is a big moment for Maiev, but we don't feel it
  needs to linger quite so long.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Amani Rage has become a staple in almost every build
  for Zul'jin. We love that it creates meaningful moments and synergizes with
  his kit, so we made it a baseline ability but had to take a little power out
  of it to compensate. We've created Amani Hide as an upgrade for it that brings
  back the armor functionality players are accustomed to.</p>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> By increasing the healing potential of Chain Heal,
  Rehgar will feel more dynamic before level 10. He will also rely less on
  Ancestral to create the healing output needed from a healer. The cooldown
  reduction will also make Tidal Waves, Earthliving Enchant, and Blood and
  Thunder more attractive picks on their respective tiers. We're reducing the
  healing of Ancestral some to compensate for his stronger base kit. During
  internal testing prior to making this change, we found the extra healing it
  offered frequently resulted in overhealing. As a result, we think this healing
  reduction won't feel as impactful as it might initially seem.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now that we've removed Anub'arak's baseline Spell
  Armor, we've also decided to normalize his Nullification Shield Talent. Since
  Harden Carapace provides him with a healthy amount of Spell Armor, it now
  shares a lot of the same design space with Nullification Shield. We want to
  make the use case for his Level 20 Talent clearer, which is to simply press
  the button when in a lot of trouble to survive burst damage.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've seen Yrel trending upward strongly since her
  release, most likely due to players beginning to master her unique playstyle.
  We've seen a large difference between players who have a lot of experience as
  Yrel (Hero level 10+) and people who are still learning the Hero. This is
  likely why we've seen her rise from her initial winrate of 40% to her current
  46%. That said, we would like her to feel a little more powerful and be
  countered by enemy picks a little less. We've increased Avenging Wrath's
  damage so she gains a little wave clear (though she'll have to use her escape
  to do so), while also allowing her to threaten enemy backlines. By reducing
  the cooldown of Divine Purpose, Yrel players won't need to channel as
  frequently which will result in fewer interrupts. We've also made several
  Talent changes to buff a few that were underperforming, and to offset the
  lower Divine Purpose cooldown.</p>

<h3 id="new-battleground-alterac-pass">New Battleground: Alterac Pass</h3>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>Please Note:</strong> Alterac Pass will become available for play in two stages during the coming weeks:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Non-Ranked Modes:</strong> During the week of June 19, Alterac Pass will enter Quick Match, Unranked, and Versus A.I. matchmaking queues, as well as Custom Games.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Ranked Play:</strong> During the week of July 10, Alterac Pass will enter the Ranked Battleground Rotation.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Learn even more about Alterac Pass by visiting the <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/battlegrounds/alterac-pass/">Heroes of the Storm
website</a>!</em></p>

<p>Alterac Pass is a 3-lane Battleground where Heroes must free imprisoned allied
troops, call in their cavalry, and take down the opposing General to claim the
Pass for their faction. In addition to enemy forces, the Alterac Mountains are
home to many treacherous hazards! Heroes must remain vigilant, as a misstep
into a mud pit can prove fatal. Teams would also be wise to recruit the
Armored Gnolls and Ice Giants who inhabit the Pass before the enemy faction
can harness these deadly creatures for their own gain.</p>

<p><strong>Cores Replaced by Generals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each team's Core has been replaced by a General who will aid them in fending off attackers.
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanndar Stormpike</strong> leads the Alliance (left team) in driving back the Horde forces at Alterac Pass.</li>
<li><strong>Drek'Thar</strong> has rallied the Horde (right team) to aid in defending the Pass against Alliance invaders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each General receives bonus Armor and damage based on the number of allied Keeps remaining. Destroy enemy Keeps to weaken their General.</li>
<li>When attacking a General directly, be prepared to finish the job! Vanndar and Drek'thar will regenerate Health once they are out of combat.</li>
<li>In addition to their Basic Attacks, they can also use two Abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Whirlwind:</strong> Deals damage in an area around the General.</li>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> The General dashes to the target enemy, dealing damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Capture Prison Camps to Call in the Cavalry!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Three minutes after a match begins, a Prison Camp will spawn for each team. Invade enemy territory, take out the Guards, and free the allied prisoners to call in a Cavalry Charge!
<ul>
<li>Channel an opposing Prison Camp to begin a breakout, and then free the prisoner by preventing the enemy team from regaining control of the Camp for 30 seconds.
<ul>
<li>Watch out for enemy Heroes and Guards! They will attempt to stop any attackers and Channel on their Prison Camp to retake control.</li>
<li>Each subsequent breakout will require the capturing team to maintain control for an additional 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once a team frees the prisoners at an enemy camp, allied Cavalry will charge down all three lanes, attacking any enemies and Structures in their paths.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry units generate an aura that increases nearby Minion and Hero Movement Speeds, and grants a damage bonus to nearby allied Heroes.
<ul>
<li>The aura's damage bonus will increase based on the number of Prison Camp events completed so far, up to a maximum of 3 events.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry on both teams will benefit from these increases independent of which team won each Prison Camp event.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subsequent Prison Camps will spawn at random within a range of time after all Cavalry from the previous event have been eliminated. This range of time is determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>From 110 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds to 150 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds.</li>
<li><strong>For example:</strong> If all Cavalry from the most recent event are defeated at the 10-minute mark, the next set of Prison Camps will spawn at random between 90 and 130 seconds later.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Armored Gnolls – Siege Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Watch out for the Gnolls who inhabit the Pass! They're formidable creatures who wield a cleaving attack that can shred a Hero's Armor in no time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ice Giants – Boss Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Ice Giants at the northern and southernmost points of the Pass tend to mind their own business, but once provoked, they've been known to hurl deadly balls of ice and even stomp the ground in an effort to Slow or Stun their foes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mud Pits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Combatants who don't mind where they step can fall victim to one of several mud pits that have sprung up within Alterac Pass.
<ul>
<li>Any Hero who enters a mud pit will find their Movement Speed reduced by 16% per second, to a maximum of 60%, for as long as they remain there.</li>
<li>Upon finding solid ground, the Hero will regain Movement Speed at 50% per second.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The bonus damage dealt by Warheads had very little
  counterplay in late-game situations. Teams could hoard Warheads and kill any
  Structure—including the Core—very quickly. Although this center bonus damage
  presented players with interesting decision points, the mechanic's problems
  outweighed its positives. We feel encouraging players to hit as many
  structures as possible is a similarly fun mechanic that is healthier for the
  game.</span></p>

<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1485586192/balanceupdate.png"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/21791354" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/21791354" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 2.33.1</small></div>

<p>We've just released a new Heroes of the Storm patch to apply a number of
balance changes and bug fixes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p><strong>Main Menu</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The region selector dropdown has been removed from the Main Menu (ESC) in order to help prevent edge-case issues that could affect other game features and result in a poor experience for the player.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p><strong>Armor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Baseline Armor has been removed from a number of Heroes. Please see the specific changes to individual Heroes below.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have experimented with baseline Armor on some of
  our Heroes for some time, but we've decided to remove this functionality for
  now. The problem with it that we've found over time is that baseline Armor was
  difficult to communicate visually. It therefore ended up being a largely
  hidden power that didn't have any major changes on gameplay. Going forward,
  we'll prefer to make Armor—and other mechanics that are effective against
  Heroes and damage types—more interesting when they are tied to game mechanics.
  To clarify, while we are removing baseline Armor from Heroes, we still like
  Armor that is tied to a window of time or has an obvious display on the Hero
  when it is active. Some examples include Greymane in Worgen form and
  Cho'gall's Ogre hide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,000 to 1,200</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,650 to 2,050</li>
<li><strong>Towers of Doom</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,100 to 1,200.</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,900 to 2,050.
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Note:</strong> Towers of Doom Forts upgrade to Keeps when the Tunnels open, approximately 12 minutes into a match.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking some of the experience offered by outer
  Towers and distributing it amongst other Structures in an effort to keep teams
  closer in levels for a little while longer. We still want to reward skillful
  play, but a team that completes the first objective is frequently able take
  out a lot of the opposing team's outer Structures. Not only did this open up a
  strategic advantage (Healing Fountains get destroyed, Fortifications provide
  less safety), but it also pushes the winning team further ahead. Usually, this
  results in one team reaching level 10 before their opponents, allowing them to
  snowball to an even greater lead. We'd like to instead slow down early game
  leads, so that winning teams have to play well for a longer period of time.</p>

<li><strong>Spirit of Vengeance (E)</strong>

<li>Cooldown increased from 10 to 13 seconds.</li>
<li>Damage increased from 100 to 180.</li>
<li>Adjusted functionality:
<ul>
<li>No longer deals bonus damage to Heroes.</li>
<li>Instead, if Spirit of Vengeance hits an enemy Hero, its cooldown is reduced by 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Blade Dance (Q)
<ul>
<li>Area of effect reduced from 4 to 3.5.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The cooldown increase for Umbral Bind will grant the
  Warden's enemies a bit more of a reprieve between cases of being chained. We
  are also shifting some of the complexity of Spirit of Vengeance into cooldown
  reduction upon hitting a Hero, rather than providing bonus Hero damage. This
  increases Maiev's capability for wave-clear, rewards players that use the
  ability to engage, and reduces its usefulness as an escape. Overall, Maiev's
  kit is still slightly over-performing, and we're hoping these changes will get
  her into a sweet spot.</p>
</blockquote>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lunara's rework has put her pick rate, win rate, and
  Talent pick rates in a pretty good spot. These changes are to address Talent
  outliers, which we'll continue to keep an eye on going forward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Nexus has changed a lot since Zagara first
  arrived. Originally, she was the ultimate lane bully, known for pushing
  enemies out of lane with Hunter Killer and draining tower ammo with her
  summons. The arrival of new solo-laners who can challenge her power, combined
  with the removal of tower ammo, has made this part of her identity less
  special. The goals of these changes are twofold: first, to slightly reduce her
  early-game laning presence, largely by reducing the early-game Health of
  Hunter Killer. Our second goal is to buff her late-game teamfight capability,
  which we're doing by improving the scaling on her abilities. Our general
  thinking is that she is mostly frustrating to lane against during the early
  game, and then she falls off in power and has less impact in teamfights, which
  results in allies relying on her to split-push instead of playing with her
  team. We're hoping that with these changes she will be a more standard Hero in
  team compositions, and can be played as a solid backline damage dealer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo is underperforming since his recent rework, so
  we've increased his baseline survivability. We expect him to rise as players
  settle into new builds and playstyles, but there was still room to buff the
  Lord of Terror. We've also addressed a few of the Talents that weren't as
  strong as their counterparts. Additionally, we've reduced the duration of
  Feast on Fear, but increased its healing per tick, so Diablo players can get
  more value out of a few healing ticks before overriding it.</p>

<p>An age-old rivalry has flared up as the Horde and Alliance battle for
dominance over a strategic pass through the Alterac Mountains. Generals from

will not tolerate traitors among their ranks.</p>

<h3 id="new-battleground-alterac-pass">New Battleground: Alterac Pass</h3>

<p><em>Learn even more about Alterac Pass by visiting the <a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/battlegrounds/alterac-pass/">Heroes of the Storm
website</a>!</em></p>

<p>Alterac Pass is a three-lane Battleground where Heroes must free imprisoned
allied troops, call in their cavalry, and take down the opposing General to
claim the Pass for their faction. In addition to enemy forces, the Alterac
Mountains are home to many treacherous hazards! Heroes must remain vigilant,
as a simple misstep into a mud pit can prove fatal. As well, teams would be
wise to recruit the Armored Gnolls and Ice Giants who inhabit the Pass before
the enemy faction can harness the deadly creatures for their own gain.</p>

<p><strong>Cores Replaced by Generals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each team's Core has been replaced by a General who will aid them in fending off attackers.
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanndar Stormpike</strong> leads the Alliance (left team) in driving back the Horde forces at Alterac Pass.</li>
<li><strong>Drek'Thar</strong> has rallied the Horde (right team) to aid in defending the Pass against Alliance invaders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each General receives bonus Armor and damage based on the number of allied Keeps remaining. Destroy enemy Keeps to weaken their General.</li>
<li>When attacking a General directly, be prepared to finish the job! Vanndar and Drek'thar will regenerate Health once they are out of combat.</li>
<li>In addition to their Basic Attacks, they can also use two Abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Whirlwind:</strong> Deals damage in an area around the General.</li>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> The General dashes to the target enemy, dealing damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Capture Prison Camps to Call in the Cavalry!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Three minutes after a match begins, a Prison Camp will spawn for each team. Invade enemy territory to reach the opposing Prison Camp, take out the Guards, and free the allied prisoners to call in a Cavalry Charge!
<ul>
<li>Channel an opposing Prison Camp to begin a breakout, and then free the prisoner by preventing the enemy team from regaining control of the Camp for 30 seconds.
<ul>
<li>Watch out for enemy Heroes and Guards! They will attempt to stop any attackers and Channel on their Prison Camp to retake control.</li>
<li>Each subsequent breakout will require the capturing team to maintain control for an additional 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once a team frees the prisoners at an enemy camp, allied Cavalry will charge down all three lanes, attacking any enemies and Structures in their paths.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry units generate an aura that increases nearby Minion and Hero Movement Speeds, and grants a damage bonus to nearby allied Heroes.
<ul>
<li>The aura's damage bonus will increase based on the number of Prison Camp events completed so far, up to a maximum of 3 events.
<ul>
<li>Cavalry on both teams will benefit from these increases independent of which team won each Prison Camp event.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subsequent Prison Camps will spawn at random within a range of time after all Cavalry from the previous event have been eliminated. This range of time is determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>From 110 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds to 150 – (# of game minutes elapsed * 2) seconds.</li>
<li><strong>For example:</strong> If all Cavalry from the most recent event are defeated at the 10-minute mark, the next set of Prison Camps will spawn at random between 90 and 130 seconds later.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Armored Gnolls – Siege Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Watch out for the Gnolls who inhabit the Pass! They're formidable creatures who wield a cleaving attack that can shred a Hero's Armor in no time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ice Giants – Boss Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Ice Giants at the northern and southernmost points of the Pass tend to mind their own business, but once provoked, they've been known to hurl deadly balls of ice—and even stomp the ground in an effort to Slow or Stun their foes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mud Pits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Combatants who don't mind where they step can fall victim to one of several mud pits that have sprung up within Alterac Pass.
<ul>
<li>Any Hero who enters a mud pit will find their Movement Speed reduced by 16% per second, to a maximum of 60%, for as long as they remain there.</li>
<li>Upon finding solid ground, the Hero will regain Movement Speed at 50% per second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Alterac Pass will become available for play in three stages over the next few weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Public Test Realm:</strong> Alterac Pass is available for play in the PTR from today until June 11.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Ranked Modes:</strong> During the week of June 19, Alterac Pass will enter Quick Match, Unranked, and Versus A.I. matchmaking queues, as well as Custom Games.</li>
<li><strong>Ranked Play:</strong> During the week of July 10, Alterac Pass will enter the Ranked Battleground Rotation.</li>

<p><strong>PTR Note:</strong> The following changes to Armor and Structures are present on the Public Test Realm but will be added to the live version of Heroes of the Storm in a separate balance patch within the next few days.</p>

<p><strong>Armor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Baseline Armor has been removed from a number of Heroes. Please see the specific changes to individual Heroes below.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have experimented with baseline Armor on some of
  our Heroes for some time, but we've decided to remove this functionality for
  now. The problem with it that we've found over time is that baseline Armor was
  difficult to communicate visually. It therefore ended up being a largely
  hidden power that didn't have any major changes on gameplay. Going forward,
  we'll prefer to make Armor—and other mechanics that are effective against
  Heroes and damage types—more interesting when they are tied to game mechanics.
  To clarify, while we are removing baseline Armor from Heroes, we still like
  Armor that is tied to a window of time or has an obvious display on the Hero
  when it is active. Some examples include Greymane in Worgen form and
  Cho'gall's Ogre hide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,000 to 1,200</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,650 to 2,050</li>
<li><strong>Towers of Doom</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fort Tower experience reduced from 500 to 250.</li>
<li>Fort experience increased from 1,100 to 1,200.</li>
<li>Keep experience increased from 1,900 to 2,050.
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Note:</strong> Towers of Doom Forts upgrade to Keeps when the Tunnels open, approximately 12 minutes into a match.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're taking some of the experience offered by outer
  Towers and distributing it amongst other Structures in an effort to keep teams
  closer in levels for a little while longer. We still want to reward skillful
  play, but a team that completes the first objective is frequently able take
  out a lot of the opposing team's outer Structures. Not only did this open up a
  strategic advantage (Healing Fountains get destroyed, Fortifications provide
  less safety), but it also pushes the winning team further ahead. Usually, this
  results in one team reaching level 10 before their opponents, allowing them to
  snowball to an even greater lead. We'd like to instead slow down early game
  leads, so that winning teams have to play well for a longer period of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The cooldown increase for Umbral Bind will grant the
  Warden's enemies a bit more of a reprieve between cases of being chained. We
  are also shifting some of the complexity of Spirit of Vengeance into cooldown
  reduction upon hitting a Hero, rather than providing bonus Hero damage. This
  increases Maiev's capability for wave-clear, rewards players that use the
  ability to engage, and reduces its usefulness as an escape. Overall, Maiev's
  kit is still slightly over-performing, and we're hoping these changes will get
  her into a sweet spot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Nexus has changed a lot since Zagara first
  arrived. Originally, she was the ultimate lane bully, known for pushing
  enemies out of lane with Hunter Killer and draining tower ammo with her
  summons. The arrival of new solo-laners who can challenge her power, combined
  with the removal of tower ammo, has made this part of her identity less
  special. The goals of these changes are twofold: first, to slightly reduce her
  early-game laning presence, largely by reducing the early-game Health of
  Hunter Killer. Our second goal is to buff her late-game teamfight capability,
  which we're doing by improving the scaling on her abilities. Our general
  thinking is that she is mostly frustrating to lane against during the early
  game, and then she falls off in power and has less impact in teamfights, which
  results in allies relying on her to split-push instead of playing with her
  team. We're hoping that with these changes she will be a more standard Hero in
  team compositions, and can be played as a solid backline damage dealer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo is underperforming since his recent rework, so
  we've increased his baseline survivability. We expect him to rise as players
  settle into new builds and playstyles, but there was still room to buff the
  Lord of Terror. We've also addressed a few of the Talents that weren't as
  strong as their counterparts. Additionally, we've reduced the duration of
  Feast on Fear, but increased its healing per tick, so Diablo players can get
  more value out of a few healing ticks before overriding it.</p>

<p><strong>MVP Screen</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players can no longer vote for themselves on the end of match awards screen.

<li>The number of votes required to achieve epic and legendary commendations on the end of match awards screen have each been reduced by one vote.
<ul>
<li>This has been done to account for the removal of self-voting. Previously, a self-vote could often make the difference for a player who was one vote shy of reaching epic or legendary status.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goals for Lunara's rework are twofold: first, we
  want to add some gameplay to Wisp and consolidate its related talents into
  something more interesting. We also want to give Lunara more potential
  playstyles, which we're doing by adding some new powerful talents into her
  tree. Because we added so much more power into her talents, we had to reduce
  her baseline power by a marginal amount to compensate. We've had a blast with
  Lunara in our internal playtests, and we're excited to release her new and
  improved version into the wild!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo's update aims to give the Lord of Terror more
  control over his kit and add fun new gameplay without compromising his core
  identity in the Nexus. We're putting the power in the hands of Diablo players
  by allowing them to target their Fire Stomps and allowing multiple fire waves
  to hit the same Hero to help execute the perfect combo. We're adding self-
  healing to Fire Stomp so that Diablo has a way to maintain his health beyond
  relying on a Support to heal him. Shadow Charge now grants increased Movement
  Speed to reduce situations where enemies are just beyond Overpower's reach
  after charging in. Diablo's level 4 Talents all allow him to collect souls in
  new ways, so he can still get the most out of his Trait during low takedown
  games. There is also a spiderweb of fun synergies and interactions between the
  Talents in his tree, so we're excited to see what creative combinations
  players will latch onto.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goals for Lunara's rework are twofold: first, we
  want to add some gameplay to Wisp and consolidate its related talents into
  something more interesting. We also want to give Lunara more potential
  playstyles, which we're doing by adding some new powerful talents into her
  tree. Because we added so much more power into her talents, we had to reduce
  her baseline power by a marginal amount to compensate. We've had a blast with
  Lunara in our internal playtests, and we're excited to release her new and
  improved version into the wild!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo's update aims to give the Lord of Terror more
  control over his kit and add fun new gameplay without compromising his core
  identity in the Nexus. We're putting the power in the hands of Diablo players
  by allowing them to target their Fire Stomps and allowing multiple fire waves
  to hit the same Hero to help execute the perfect combo. We're adding self-
  healing to Fire Stomp so that Diablo has a way to maintain his health beyond
  relying on a Support to heal him. Shadow Charge now grants increased Movement
  Speed to reduce situations where enemies are just beyond Overpower's reach
  after charging in. Diablo's level 4 Talents all allow him to collect souls in
  new ways, so he can still get the most out of his Trait during low takedown
  games. There is also a spiderweb of fun synergies and interactions between the
  Talents in his tree, so we're excited to see what creative combinations
  players will latch onto.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our resident warlock has been in and out of the meta
  a couple times since his epic release and his Talent tree has become a bit
  lopsided. We began these changes by looking at Rain of Destruction (even going
  as far as testing the Ability without a channel!) but quickly realized that we
  would need more than just a balance patch to appropriately address the Heroic.
  We were, however, able to make some Talent adjustments that will hopefully
  give players fun new ways to drain the life from their opponents!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes require Hanzo to put himself at greater
  risk to deal the considerable amount of damage that he can dish out over the
  course of a game. While we believe Hanzo has a unique place as an Assassin who
  specializes in using his superior range to kite enemies, he was able to do so
  too safely, which was crowding out other ranged Assassins.</p>

  of the Deckard player. Many of his Talents are also looking to be in good

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are meant to make the immediate
  aftermath of being thrown by Wrecking Ball a little less punishing for
  Garrosh's opponents, particularly when he throws an enemy Hero and then Stuns
  them with Groundbreaker. We're slightly reducing Groundbreaker's Stun duration
  so that enemy Heroes can more quickly pop defensive cooldowns to try to
  survive. We're also compensating Garrosh with a slight increase to
  Groundbreaker's Slow. This way, he can still reliably catch enemies if he
  starts with Groundbreaker and wants to close in for a throw.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Battle Rage is proving to be the dominant pick on its
  Talent tier and provides a lot of generic power to Sonya's kit. Rather than
  nerf it, we're placing it against stronger Talents at Level 7 to lessen the
  amount of generic power she can get overall. Similarly, Mystical Spear at 13
  is giving a bit too much raw power in addition to its utility. It should now
  be more in-line with the more situational Talents at that tier.</p>

  <p><span class="text-warning"><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We believe the Warhead Junction boss is a cool
  variant of the standard golem boss found on most maps, but it had some
  inconsistencies that needed addressing. These changes essentially make the
  boss a better version of itself—its neutral and captured versions are closer
  in power, and its Slime Pods create a cooler moment than its Podlings did
  previously.</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re making some changes to Genji to try and make
  him less frustrating to play against and give opponents more options with
  which to counter him. While we think resetting Swift Strike’s cooldown after
  killing enemy Heroes with Dragonblade made for cool, flashy plays, it shut
  down too many other Heroes too often. It also caused too many games to become
  about how much value Genji was able to get out of Dragonblade and little else.
  We like the flashiness that Dragonblade resets can provide, so we’re keeping
  that functionality, but we’re now adding it to his Level 20 Storm Talent
  version of the Heroic. We’re also increasing his Health and Basic Attack
  damage, reducing the range of Swift Strike, and increasing the cooldown of
  Cyber Agility to reduce his mobility while boosting his base stats to
  compensate.</p>

<li>Now also resets Swift Strike’s cooldown if an enemy Hero dies within 2 seconds after being hit by Dragonblade.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re making some changes to Genji to try and make
  him less frustrating to play against and give opponents more options to
  counter him. While we think resetting Swift Strike’s cooldown after killing
  enemy Heroes with Dragonblade made for cool, flashy plays, it shut down too
  many other Heroes too often. It also caused too many games to become about how
  much value Genji was able to get out of Dragonblade. We like the flashiness
  that Dragonblade resets can provide, so we’re keeping that functionality, but
  we’re now adding it to his Level 20 Storm Talent version of the Heroic. We’re
  also increasing his Health and Basic Attack damage, reducing the range of
  Swift Strike, and increasing the cooldown of Cyber Agility to reduce his
  mobility while boosting his base stats to compensate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As part of our ongoing quest to increase counter-play
  and curb frustration when playing against certain Heroes, we’re changing
  Sylvanas’ Black Arrows trait so that her Abilities no longer disable
  Structures. This effect is incredibly powerful and, in the past, has limited
  how Battlegrounds can be designed and played. We realize that turning off
  enemy Structures is an important part of Sylvanas’ identity, so rather than
  removing this functionality completely, we’re addressing it in such a way that
  she now has to put herself in danger to get maximum value. This should allow
  more counter-play for opponents when Sylvanas is pushing, and enable us to
  improve her teamfight capabilities, which we’re doing initially via a small
  Basic Attack damage buff. We’ll be keeping an eye on her performance, and are
  ready to make further tuning changes as needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re making adjustments focused on the viability of
  some of Tyrael’s Talents. In particular, Sword of Justice was not picked very
  often, and was underperforming. We’re addressing this by taking a few Talents
  (Stalwart Angel, Burning Halo, and Smite the Wicked) and increasing their
  synergy with Sword of Justice by increasing the bonuses that Tyrael receives
  while El’druin is out, but reducing the bonuses for teleporting. This should
  enhance Sword of Justice’s playstyle, by allowing players to teleport into a
  fight, but still having an active El’druin’s.</p>

</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Choose one Hero from a curated roster and work together with your allies to defend the Port’s fortifications.</li>
<li>Hold off the invading zerg long enough for Mira Han to activate the Psi Disruptor.</li>
<li>Stay on the lookout for infested Heroes and devastating Infested Archangels, which have been sighted in the area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get the complete sit-rep by reading the <a href="https://battle.net/heroes/blog/21646097">Deadman's Stand Preview blog</a> and prepare to stand against the tide when this brawl goes live on Friday, March 30!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AzmoDUNK!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each Gem turned in now grants 3 Taste for Blood stacks.</li>
<li>Killing a Hero with Globe of Annihilation now resets its cooldown and refunds its Mana cost.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> With AzmoDUNK, we want to really reward successful
  dunks. To do so, we’ve added a free throw after a successful kill with a
  Globe. This should allow for some really exciting hot streaks. We’ve also
  updated the Tomb mechanic to give stacks of Taste for Blood, allowing a team
  who plays the mechanic to build stacks quite a bit quicker.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As part of our ongoing effort to trim the frustration
  of playing against certain Heroes, we are making some tuning changes to
  Tracer. The general philosophy for these changes is threefold: reduce her
  overall mobility over time, reduce her burst damage, and increase the amount
  of time that she needs to stay in range of opponents in order to be effective.
  While we understand that reducing her burst damage via Melee and Pulse Bomb
  are significant nerfs to her power, we are compensating her by increasing her
  Health and Basic Attack damage. This should reward Tracer players who are able
  to bob and weave through opposing skillshots while staying on their target.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making a simple change to Varian by moving his
  Heroic Abilities to Level 4, but this will have large impact on the way he
  feels during a game. By allowing Varian to get his Heroic Ability earlier, he
  can fulfill the role his team needs before one team develops a significant
  lead over the other. This increase in Varian’s early-game power justifies
  reducing some of the overwhelming power he gains after level 10, and creates a
  more even experience for Varian and his opponents throughout a game.</p>

<h4 id="greymane">Greymane</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Razor Swipe (Q)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 3 to 4 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Visceral Attacks (Q)
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1 to 1.5 seconds per Basic Attack</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We’re increasing the cooldown of Razor Swipe in an
  effort to stem some of Greymane’s effectiveness when taking Mercenaries and
  clearing Minion waves. Currently, Greymane’s play-style is great, but he does
  everything a little too well, which makes him a consistently safe pick. To
  curb this, we’d like to remove some of the PvE-oriented power from his kit.</p>

<h4 id="maiev">Maiev</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vault of the Wardens (D)</strong>

<li>Cooldown reduced from 65 to 50 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warden’s Cage (R)</strong>

<li><strong>Level 4</strong>

<li>Blade Dance (Q)

<li>Damage reduced from 54 to 50</li>

<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shadow Armor (E)
<ul>
<li>Armor reduced from 25 to 20</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Maiev is still a powerhouse in the Nexus. To combat
  this, we’re reducing Maiev’s damage potential by lowering Fan of Knives damage
  and Blade Dance (which has powerful synergy with Armored Assault, another
  overperforming Talent.) We’re also allowing opponents more opportunities to
  punish Maiev by increasing Vault of the Wardens’ cooldown and reducing the
  power of Shadow Armor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="thrall">Thrall</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Crash Lightning (Q)
<ul>
<li>Maximum damage bonus reduced from 480 to 360</li>
<li>Quest completion reward requirement increased from 20 to 30 stacks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> With the increased bounce range of Chain lightning,
  the Crash Lightning talent has become overly dominant. While we enjoy the
  build, as it allows Thrall to play outside of the solo-lane, in its current
  state it is simply too powerful. By lowering the maximum stacks, we’re
  reducing the upper damage limit to lessen the impact of the extreme situations
  where Thrall is completely stacked. Additionally, with the Quest Completion
  moving back to 30 stacks, it’s going to be harder for Thrall to finish the
  talent, pushing this power-spike to later in the match.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Auriel has been overlooked in favor of other supports
  recently, so to increase her self-Hope generation and play-making potential,
  we’re increasing her Basic Attack damage and reducing the cooldown of
  Detainment Strike. We’ve also made some Talent adjustments so players feel
  like they have a greater variety of choices at the various tiers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 40 to 50 seconds</li>
<li>Exit Bunker now has a 1 second cooldown before it can be used</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we love the creative uses of Bunker Drop, at
  the higher levels of play it is slightly too effective. These changes are
  designed to decrease the overall power of the Bunker when it’s used purely to
  dodge enemy abilities and clear debuffs. We’d like to ensure that players who
  get into the Bunker are committed to being inside, if only briefly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rampage (Passive)
<ul>
<li>Ancient Spear cooldown reduction decreased from .75 to .5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sonya is getting a bit too much value out of the
  combination of all the Ancient Spear talents, so we’re reducing the amount of
  cooldown reduction she gets to keep these from being the default choices.
  We’re also reducing the healing potential of Battle Rage at level 4 as it was
  providing a bit too much generic survivability for an early game talent.
  Finally, we’re increasing the damage bonus provided by Furious Blows to make
  it a more attractive damage option against the other two survivability
  talents.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> With AzmoDUNK, we want to really reward successful
  dunks. To do so, we’ve added a free throw after a successful kill with a
  Globe. This should allow for some really exciting hot streaks. We’ve also
  updated the Tomb mechanic to give stacks of Taste for Blood, allowing a team
  who plays the mechanic to build stacks quite a bit quicker.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As part of our ongoing effort to trim the frustration
  of playing against certain Heroes, we are making some tuning changes to
  Tracer. The general philosophy for these changes is threefold: reduce her
  overall mobility over time, reduce her burst damage, and increase the amount
  of time that she needs to stay in range of opponents in order to be effective.
  While we understand that reducing her burst damage via Melee and Pulse Bomb
  are significant nerfs to her power, we are compensating her by increasing her
  Health and Basic Attack damage. This should reward Tracer players who are able
  to bob and weave through opposing skillshots while staying on their target.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making a simple change to Varian by moving his
  Heroic Abilities to Level 4, but this will have large impact on the way he
  feels during a game. By allowing Varian to get his Heroic Ability earlier, he
  can fulfill the role his team needs before one team develops a significant
  lead over the other. This increase in Varian’s early-game power justifies
  reducing some of the overwhelming power he gains after level 10, and creates a
  more even experience for Varian and his opponents throughout a game.</p>
