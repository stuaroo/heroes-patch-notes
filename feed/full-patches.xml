<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep structure damage reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Structures will only focus their attacks on enemy Heroes if they attack an allied Hero who is also in their range.</li>
<li>Self-damage from Heroes will no longer cause structures to focus them.</li>
<li>Periodic damage over time will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to the Call for Help system
  that should help the overall player experience. We believe that currently
  Towers are punishing aggressive play too much, so we're lowering their damage
  to give diving Heroes more time to make plays before they have to escape. Our
  goal overall with the system is to still have aggressive play be possible and
  rewarded, but to also give the defending team a way to punish prolonged Tower
  dives, which is primarily due to the stacking Armor debuff. We're also
  changing the A.I. of structures to require that both the attacking and
  defending Hero be in their range in order for them to switch aggro onto an
  aggressor. This means that the defending Hero needs to also be near their
  structures in order to be defended, and it removes some unintuitive situations
  where a Hero can get aggro from attacks that are happening in far away places.
  Lastly, periodic damage will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes, so
  Heroes like Lunara will no longer pull aggro for the entirety of their DoT
  effects.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Objective Missile damage increased from 1800 to 1900.</li>
<li><strong>Samurai Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Laner version Health reduced from 8,000 to 7,200.</li>
<li>Laner version Health scaling reduced by ~10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players believe the pushing
  Samurai camp is too strong and the objective is too weak. For some insight, we
  purposefully designed the map so that the Samurai camp was uniquely powerful,
  and we wanted it to be a viable, effective strategy that was available for a
  large portion of the game, particularly since the map only has 2 lanes. Now
  that the map has been out for some time, we believe that the balance of power
  can shift a little in favor of the objective being a more central way to win
  the game.</p>

<li><strong>Reactive Parry [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Damaging enemies with the first slash of Twin Blades grants Artanis 75 Physical Armor against the next enemy Hero Basic Attack. If the target is an enemy Hero, then the second slash grants Artanis an additional stack. Stores up to 2 charges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New Talent: Protector of Aiur [Passive]</strong>

<li>Additional functionality: Phase Prism Slows the enemy's Movement Speed by 30% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Artanis some small baseline buffs and
  changing some of his lesser-picked talents to have more practical use cases.
  We're also combining the effects of Warp Sickness and Chrono Surge into one
  talent, which should make that choice at Level 7 more powerful overall while
  also giving a clearer choice for Artanis players who want to build around
  hitting enemy Heroes with Phase Prism.</p>

<li>Healing increased from 2.5% to 3% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathwing continues to be a terror in the Nexus.
  While he's in a much better place now, he can use some more toning down. We're
  also addressing Skyfall's domination of his Level 7 talents but removing one
  of its effects and giving it to Firestorm. For players who want to build
  around going up and landing more often, Firestorm will now be the premier
  talent for that playstyle, whereas players who want to do damage while in the
  air, interrupt objectives, or heal themselves more can continue to take
  Skyfall.</p>

<ul>
<li>While Dehaka is in a bush and for 5 seconds after leaving, he gains 20 Armor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been quite awhile since we last changed Dehaka,
  and the game has changed significantly since that time. We're giving him a
  small buff to Dark Swarm and combining Constriction and Paralyzing Enzymes to
  create a more powerful, single talent. We're also adding a strong defensive
  option at Level 16 that plays into his desire to fight near bushes.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the Movement Speed of enemy Heroes hit by Celestial Charge by 25% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To help it compete with other talents on its tier and
  to give it a little more identity, we're adding a Slow to Pathetic Mortals.
  This change will also help the talent's visual clarity since enemies will be
  Slowed while they have the damage reduction debuff.</p>

<li>Damage to enemies hit by its outer area increased from 198 to 250.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since Sulfuras Smash was the
  premier Heroic on Ragnaros, back when he and his best buddy Taunt Varian
  dominated the competitive scene. Things have changed, and over the years Lava
  Wave has risen to dominance, so we're giving Sulfuras Smash some love so that
  it can see a return to its glory days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sustaining Power has been a difficult sell as a
  competitive option for Alarak. Players who want to improve Lightning Surge are
  more inclined to go for Extended Lightning, since it adds more benefits that
  synergize with later talents. Instead of buffing Sustaining Power in hopes
  that it outshines Extended Lightning, we're changing it to do its own unique
  effect. Overwhelming Power should synergize well with talents like Hindered
  Motion and Mocking Strikes, allowing Alarak players who are able to stick to
  their targets to do a lot of sustained damage while keeping themselves alive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since her release, Cassia has been a great counter-
  pick against teams bringing multiple Basic Attackers. When she was being
  created, the Hero Designer was working closely with the Live Design team to
  find a good niche for her to fill. Since that time, however, our design
  philosophies have changed, and you have been seeing us pull-back from any
  individual Hero being too sharp in their designs. The War Matron is no
  exception and her rework tries to keep her original playstyle intact while
  also opening up options for players to bring her into more team compositions.
  Our other goals with the rework were to enhance her Lightning Javazon fantasy
  and introduce new talent-interactions for aficionados to really sink their
  teeth into. It would seem that with Cassia lightning does in fact strike twice
  and we are excited to see what you can do with her!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We always have to be careful about introducing too
  much power into Hero designs that are both mobile and bursty, because even if
  they are balanced on paper, they can feel extremely oppressive to play
  against. When this does happen, our normal reaction is to slowly tune those
  Heroes down until they don't feel awful to play against. Unfortunately, this
  can cause a variety of issues; in Tracer's case, she became extremely reliant
  on a handful of other Heroes to really open up her kit and make it work. With
  her rework, we focused on trying to make her feel a bit more self-reliant
  while also giving opponents a bit more time to react to her Recall and lock
  her down. On top of this, we have rebuilt her talent tree in order to give our
  Pulse-Pistol wielding Heroine some fun new options while she time-jumps around
  the Nexus.</p>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch is live and brings a new Dark Nexus II
event, new skins and mounts, along with a Tassadar rework and more! Read on
for more information.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blackheart's Bay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot a cannonball at 2 nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage, slowing them by 70% for 1.5 seconds, and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot 5 missiles at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage per missile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cursed Hollow</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 3 seconds, the Core will spawn a Curse under a nearby enemy Hero. If they are Cursed, they take 5% maximum Health as damage and their Armor is reduced by 75 for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dragonshire</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core will throw 2 boulders at a nearby enemy Hero. Heroes hit are turned to stone, damaged for 5% of their maximum Health, and Stunned for 1.75 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Garden of Terror</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core shoots a seed under a nearby enemy Hero. When the seed explodes, Heroes inside are Polymorphed for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core fires 2 volleys of missiles around it, dealing 5% maximum Health to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sky Temple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 23 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 sets of 6 tornadoes which swirl around it, dealing 25 damage to enemy Heroes and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core will shoot a Death Wave, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volskaya</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core shoots 3 Rocket Fists at nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 150 damage and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warhead Junction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 18 seconds, the Core launches a Nuke at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 30% maximum health to enemy Heroes hit.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Follow behavior is the same for disconnected player A.I. and normal A.I.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will attempt to fight while remaining close to their follow target, leashing back if they wander too far away.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will mount or use their Hearthstone if their follow target uses their mount or Hearthstone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting A.I. Healing Well goal health threshold from 75% to 60%.</li>
<li>Bringing an A.I. who is on follow close enough to Doubloon turn-in on Blackheart's Bay, Soul Gem turn-in on Tomb of the Spider Queen, or a healing fountain will cause the A.I. to interact with them appropriately if they are able.</li>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

<h4 id="xul">Xul</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2200 to 2080.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.58 to 4.33.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

<h4 id="xul">Xul</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2200 to 2080.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.58 to 4.33.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>

<h4 id="arthas">Arthas</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2782 to 2860.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration increased from 5.80 to 5.96.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rune Tap [Passive]</strong>

<li>Healing increased from 4% to 5% maximum Health.</li>

<li><strong>Army of the Dead [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tooltip now states how much damage Ghouls do.</li>

<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legion of Northrend [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase Ghoul Basic Attack damage by 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Absolute Zero [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Root duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
<li>Slow duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-Magic Shell [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Arthas is slightly underperforming compared to other
  Warriors, so we're giving him a small baseline Health buff which we feel is
  appropriate since he doesn't have the mobility that a lot of other Warriors
  bring to the table. We've also taken a look at his Level 20 talents and beefed
  them up all be much more epic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Devastating Charge [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage when hitting enemies into terrain increased from 120 to 130.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diabolical Momentum [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.25 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since we changed Devastating Charge Diablo has fallen
  off a bit. While we believe he's in a more healthy spot overall, we understand
  how players miss the unique role he had as a tank who had the ability to burst
  down enemies who are out of position. We're giving a little bit of that back
  in the form of a baseline buff to Shadow charge so that he can have some of
  that fantasy back no matter how players choose to build him.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="tyrael">Tyrael</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense of the Angels [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 120 to 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now the Defense of the Angels no longer has a
  cooldown reduction component, we're reducing its cooldown to be more in line
  with similar effects.</p>

<li>Healing bonus increased from 60% to 70%.</li>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blaze of Glory [W]</strong>

<li><strong>Level 13</strong>

<li><strong>Unrelenting Descent [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 5 to 10 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brand of Solarion [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Imperius a slew of buffs to
  underperforming talents, which we believe will push him into being a more
  stable pick on most maps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="rexxar">Rexxar</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage increased from 125 to 134.</li>
<li>Misha Health reduced from 1620 to 1520.</li>
<li>Misha Health Regeneration reduced from 3.38 to 3.17.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mend Pet [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mana cost increased from 60 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rexxar's ability to win the laning phase on point
  control maps is a little too powerful, so we're nerfing his ability to keep
  Misha alive. To compensate him for this nerf, we're increasing his Basic
  Attack damage, which will both help him in latter parts of the game and make
  the early game more about how well he can work with Misha to outtrade the
  enemy Hero. We're hoping that this leads to more interaction in the laning
  phase, with fewer instances of Misha being able to stand on a point for
  prolonged periods of time while the opposing hero is unable to push her off.
  We know there is a fine line between keeping his unique role on these maps and
  feeling too oppressed when playing against him, so we'll be keeping an eye on
  these changes and will tune as necessary going forward.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kalan's Edict [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Each time Skeletal Warriors deal damage, reduce the cooldown of Bone Armor and Xul's Heroic Ability by 1.5%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Xul's rework has arrived! Our goal with these changes
  is primarily to make him feel more like a Diablo Necromancer, and to make his
  Skeletons a larger part of his kit outside of their pushing potential. Xul now
  has the ability to spawn Skeletal Warriors in combat via Spectral Scythe, and
  they now explode for damage when they die, giving enemy Heroes a reason to
  stay away from them while they mow them down. We also updated Xul's talents to
  embrace this fantasy, with many options to use Skeletons as a mechanism to
  deliver various buffs to Xul and debuffs to the enemy team. We had a blast
  testing him, and hope you enjoy him as much as we have!</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Gladiator's War Shout a fairly
  substantial buff to make it more powerful and interesting, and as a result
  also buffing Bloodlust. We're hoping this opens up an alternative playstyle

  originally intended it to be this way to separate it a bit from other similar

<li>Duration before the ability can be cancelled after charging reduced from 1 to .75 seconds.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making this change to reduce the amount of time
  that The Butcher has to commit to a charge before he can cancel it. Currently
  there is an awkward time where he charges and may want to cancel it as soon as
  possible, but he is forced to move a fair amount forward before he can cancel
  his charge. To make this feel more responsive, we're reducing this window of
  time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our thinking with our Raynor changes in our previous
  patch was to solve a design problem with Ace in the Hole's mandatory synergy
  with Unstable Compound, while simultaneously giving him a bit of a buff
  overall by making his other two talents measure up to its new power. While
  this was largely successful, we underestimated how much more powerful Ace in
  the Hole would become compared to the new, buffed alternatives. We're lowering
  its damage a bit to compensate for the Slow that it gained, which should make
  the tier more even overall.</p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: While under 60% maximum Health, Cho receives 15% additional Movement Speed and healing received.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Each time Cho deals damage to enemy Heroes, he is healed for 60 over 3 seconds. Enemy Heroes hit by Gall's Dread Orb receive 35% less healing for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In regards to his trait, we want optimal play for
  Cho'gall to be to have Gall's Ogre Rage be active most of the time, with
  emergency switches to Cho's Ogre Hide when he is in danger. There are a few
  talents on Cho'galls tree that disincentivize this behavior, which we are
  adjusting now. Calloused Hide in particular was becoming an issue, as players
  have recently been finding it optimal to stay in Ogre Hide for the entire
  game, which removes the gameplay around the trait.</p>

<li>Damage reduced from 63 to 60.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mal'Ganis have been slightly too powerful for some
  time, so we're toning him down a bit.</p>

<h4 id="muradin">Muradin</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<li>Removed.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Impact [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.25 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we've looked at Muradin.
  He's been such a staple in the meta for so long that we did not feel he needed
  any large changes. While minor, these buffs should help bring him back into
  the spotlight as a valuable member of any team.</p>

<li><strong>Pulverize [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 16.</li>
<li>Slow amount increased from 75% to 80%.</li>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lacerate [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>

<li><strong>Digestive Juices [E]</strong>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gas Flare [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Stitches some love by slightly
  increasing his crowd control capabilities and moving his Level 16 talents to
  come online earlier in the game. Since they add a lot of power to his ability
  to function as a powerful front line Warrior for his team, this should help
  him make plays for a greater portion of the game.</p>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tyrael">Tyrael</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Archangel's Wrath [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Each enemy Hero hit reduces Tyrael's death timer by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ardent Restoration [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from 3.5 to 4 per stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyrael's Level 20 talents have been reordered to follow normal conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Defense of the Angels [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Activate to gain 50 Armor for 3 seconds. Each time Tyrael damages an enemy Hero with a Basic Attack or Basic Ability, increase the duration of this Armor bonus by .5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It has been a longstanding request to make Tyrael's
  trait have some more oomph to it, so we're giving him a thematic change where
  he can reduce his death timer when hitting enemy Heroes. We don't expect this
  to be a huge winrate bump, but we do think it makes it feel a bit better to
  play as the Archangel of Justice.</p>

<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduced from 3% to 2.5% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathwing continues to be a force to be reckoned
  with, so we're continuing to adjust his power level down. Rather than doing
  one fairly large set of Health, damage, and talent nerfs which can easily go
  overboard, we're taking a more incremental approach.</p>

<h4 id="malthael">Malthael</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>

<li><strong>Throwing Shade [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer has a quest component.</li>
<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 4 to 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost of Death Shroud after taking talent increased from 25 to 30.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tormented Souls [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 80 to 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Last Rites [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 65 to 70 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Throwing Shade has not really worked out as an
  interesting Quest talent, as Malthael is often in a solo lane with only one
  opponent. Rather than gate the benefit behind what is often an arbitrary time
  gate, we're going to give him its benefits immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li>No longer increases the range of Toxic Nest.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the duration of Toxic Nest by 45 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To curb some of the frustrating gameplay where
  Abathur can continuously backdoor enemy Keeps, we're reducing some of the
  buffs we gave to Locust Strain, as well as changing the functionality of
  Prolific Dispersal. While Abathur players can still do this strategy, it will
  be more difficult to pull off, as Abathur will have to travel to a more
  central location on the map to plant a Toxic Nest for vision to burrow into
  the enemy base.</p>

<li>No longer increases the radius of Expulsion Zone.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Expulsion Zone by 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we made some serious
  changes to Zarya's talents, so these changes should shake things up a bit for
  her. Plasma Shock in particular was not seeing much play, so we're rolling its
  functionality into Pinpoint Accuracy, and buffing other talents on the tier to
  keep their competitiveness. We're also redesigning Clear Out to give a massive
  cooldown reduction to Expulsion Zone instead of a radius increase, as we found
  the radius increase to not be the most impactful or fun Level 20 upgrade.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While our recent changes to Resurrect have put Auriel
  in the spotlight, she has been performing a bit too well compared to other
  Healers for some time now. We're reducing some of her power to keep her more

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While reasonably powerful, Rejuvenation didn't give

  changing the talent to have a little more visual clarity and gameplay compared
  to before, which should help improve its performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't satisfied that the changes we recently

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In keeping in line with our changes to Cho, we're

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These are minor tuning changes intended to help
  Jaina's build diversity. Ice Floes in particular is in a potentially powerful
  spot in the right situations, as when combined with Icy Veins and Northern
  Exposure or Numbing Blast, can do a lot of AoE damage to the enemy team in a
  short amount of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Similar to Orphea last patch, we're removing a use
  case where it often felt like a requirement to take two talents together for
  their full effect. Ace in the Hole will now give Raynor the Slow that he
  desperately wants for its proc, and to make sure that his other Level 1
  talents are competitive, we're giving them a boost as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We like how the new Barricade is playing, but since
  Sgt. Hammer's Mana tension is now fairly high, taking the talent often meant
  that she would very quickly run out of Mana. We're giving it a hefty Mana cost
  reduction, which should make it an even more attractive pick.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In addition to buffing underperforming talents, we're

  good Abathur players who pay close attention to their position on the map and

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We knew Auriel's Resurrect changes were going to be a
  big deal, and for the most part they have been going fairly well. It's now
  picked much more often, and, to our pleasant surprise, isn't winning by a
  large margin over Crystal Aegis. While we like the epic moment of power that
  the current iteration offers, there is understandably a bit of frustration
  with Heroic now. To add some more counter-play, we're reducing its cast range
  and adding more to its cast time to give opponents a better chance to
  interrupt her. Auriel players will now have to choose their moments much more
  wisely if they hope to get a Resurrect off on a key ally who recently died.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Bio-Explosion Switch has always been in a bit of an
  awkward spot due to the opportunity cost of ending Lurking Arm early. To make
  the talent more obviously powerful, we're adding some significant damage to
  the explosion and a larger Silence duration to the detonation to make up for
  the fact that Stukov's Lurking Arm goes away when the explosion happens. Now,
  if Stukov players properly detonate the Lurking Arm right as their enemies are
  leaving it, they should have a significant benefit when taking this talent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Maiev is a terror in the hands of the more
  elite portion of our playerbase, we don't want that to be a reason to not
  improve talents that we feel could use the help. Cruel Chain and Vengeful
  Knives have parts of their functionality that didn't feel particularly
  impactful, so we're adding more clear and useful benefits to each of them,

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Samuro's rework, statistically, has gone very well.
  His pick and win rates across his talents are in a better spot, and we believe
  his frustration levels have decreased since the changes. We're being tame with
  our initial changes due to some bug fixes that can change how some talents pan
  out over the long haul. While we wait, we wanted to buff a couple
  underperforming talents that shouldn't be affected by these fixes.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Nightmare [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Dread's explosion by 25%.</li>
<li>Now shows Crit kickers when hitting 2 or more enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ancestral Strength [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer grants additional Chaos when hitting Stunned, Rooted, Silenced, or Slowed enemy Heroes.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemy Heroes who are hit with Overflowing Chaos are Slowed by 20% for 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fright [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New talent: Chaotic Assault [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic attacks against enemy Heroes while having 3 stacks of Chaos deal an additional 50% bonus damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lurking terror [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: If Chomp is cast in this way, then it Slows enemy Heroes hit by 70% for 1 second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying to solve a few issues with Orphea's
  current talent tree. Firstly, we're getting rid of the necessary synergy
  between Ancestral Strength and Fright, opting to instead bake a more reliable
  way to Slow enemies into Ancestral Strength. We're also buffing Growing
  Nightmare so that it's the premier E talent in an E build, as well as giving
  Lurking Terror some love. Ideally, Lurking Terror can now be used as a more
  unique way to set up Q and W hits on enemies who are far away from Orphea,
  particularly when combined with Insatiable for quick double W combos.</p>

<h4 id="probius">Probius</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Particle Accelerator [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maximum bonus damage for enemies hit reduced from 50% to 40%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Disruption Pulse by .5 seconds, plus an additional .5 seconds whenever Warp Rift explodes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tower Defense [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Photon Cannon by 4 seconds whenever Probius damages an enemy Hero with Disruption Pulse or Warp Rift.</li>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repulsor [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>

<li><strong>Interference [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemies that are hit by Warp Rift's explosion are knocked away from its center.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We haven't done many functionality changes to
  Probius's talents since his release, so we're now taking a look at places that
  could use some design love. We're targeting Tower Defense and Particle
  Accelerator as talents that should feel more prominent in their respective
  builds, as well as removing Repulsor and baking its functionality into
  Interference, as it wasn't enough of a stand-alone talent to be worth picking
  the majority of the time.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Both Barricade and Pulse Detonation Core have very
  low pick rates, so we're giving them some love, which should hopefully
  incentivize players to try them out more often.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to the week of March 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be New Toy Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from New Toy Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gaining Unstoppable now prevents and removes Blinds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've read recent feedback that it is strange that
  Silences are removed by the Unstoppable behavior, but Blinds are not. While
  Unstoppable has traditionally been primarily intended to remove effects that
  cause a hero to not be able to control the movement of their character, this
  philosophy gets a little grey when it comes to Silences, as heroes can still
  freely move, but they lose their ability to use movement abilities. In the
  past we decided that it was better for Silences to be removed, but understand
  the argument that Blinds are effectively Silences for auto-attack based
  heroes. We're trying this change to see how it pans out, as Blinds have
  traditionally been very powerful forms of soft CC in our game and this can
  help out heroes that are heavily shut down by them.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experience Globes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes who kill Minions with Abilities or Basic Attacks will automatically collect the experience from the Minions.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will no longer time out while travelling to a hero.</li>
<li>They will still expire if the hero moves out of range of the Experience Globe before it reaches them.</li>
<li>Removed a .5 second delay before Experience Globes can be collected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we're excited for the experience globes and the
  increased clarity that they offer in regards to how experience is gained,
  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locust Swarm [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 62 to 68.</li>
<li>Healing increased from 21 to 24.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debilitation [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spellpower reduction duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beetle, Juiced [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Health of Beetles by 20%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These buffs are to some of Anub'arak's talents that
  have been lagging behind their competitors for some time. Beetle, Juiced in
  particular should now be more consistent in its benefit to round out a Beetle-
  oriented build, even if Anub'arak isn't able to get a lot of Basic Attacks off
  on enemy Heroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surging Fist [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Channel time to charge maximum distance reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Ogre Hide is active, Cho gains 15% Movement Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Gall's Ogre Rage is active, enemy Heroes who are hit by Gall's Dread Orb have their Healing reduced by 35% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Veil [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor bonus increased from 100% to 200%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since our Old God worshipping Ogre
  has had some love, so we're both buffing up some of Cho's weaker talents as
  well as reducing the time that Surging Fist needs to be channeled in order to
  get a significant charge. This should help make Cho's Q build more viable as
  well as allow him to better reposition himself during teamfights.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Condemn [W]</strong>

<li>Damage reduced from 58 to 55.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Johanna's become a dominant force in the tanking
  world, and is currently the #1 most picked hero at high level play. Because of
  this, we're slightly reducing her Health, as well as reverting her previous
  Condemn buff.</p>

<li><strong>Elementium Plating [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield amount reduced from 35% to 30% missing Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It turns out that Deathwing has lived up to his name,
  and has been destroying the Nexus since his release. Cataclysm and Burn
  Beneath My Shadow in particular have proven to be incredibly powerful, so
  we're reducing their effectiveness by a fairly significant amount. In addition
  to these changes, we're reducing the power of some overperforming talents as
  well as slightly nerfing his Destroyer form. Even with these changes, we
  expect Deathwing to continue to be a powerful addition to any team that he's
  on.</p>

<h4 id="thrall">Thrall</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling Thunder [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: [Passive] Increase the number of Chain Lightning bounces by 1. For 8 seconds after hitting an enemy with Chain Lightning, Thrall's next Basic Attack against them grants him a stack of Frostwolf Resilience. If the target is an enemy Hero, then he also deals damage to them equal to 2% of their maximum Health and healing for the same amount.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Echo of the Elements and Crash Lightning are both
  fairly solid talents that have different use cases for when to pick them.
  Rolling Thunder has been less successful, so we're trying something new with
  the talent. We're still keeping its theme of marking targets with Chain
  Lightning and then hitting them for a bonus, but now this bonus will allow
  Thrall to deal bonus damage to enemy Heroes while also interacting with
  Frostwolf Resilience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="varian">Varian</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frenzy [R3]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer increases Varian's Attack Speed by 15%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Heroic Strike by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't super happy with the power of Frenzy's
  buff, as well as that it asked Varian players to learn a new Basic Attack
  cadence after being used to one speed the whole game. Instead, we're turning
  the Attack Speed bonus into a bonus to his damage over time by buffing Heroic
  Strike instead.</p>

<li>Physical Armor duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Avenger [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Avenging Wrath at maximum charge also increases its damage by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templar's Verdict [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 6% to 7% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Favor [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holy Wrath [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus splash damage increased from 20% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word of Glory [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the amount that Yrel heals from damage received from 50% to 75%.</li>
<li>Range of allied healing increased from 8 to 12.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are mostly looking to buff Yrel's late-
  game by adding more power to her Level 16 talents. We want her to be more
  relevant without dominating the solo lane too much, so we're opting to make
  her Level 16 tier to be an exciting spike for her to hit in her games.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying some fairly significant buffs to
  Resurrect in order to help it better compete with Crystal Aegis. Auriel can
  now Resurrect herself, which should help if she is the focus of the enemy
  team, and her targets will now come back faster and with all of their Health.</p>

<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Polymorph's range by 30%. If Brightwing hits an enemy Hero with Arcane Flare's center within 2 seconds of being Polymorphed, then reduce Polymorph's cooldown by 7 seconds and gain 50 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last changes to Brightwing have better rounded
  out her talents, however Greater Polymorph was a little too hard to
  consistently proc. Instead of requiring her to hit a Polymorphed target, she
  now has a slightly larger window of time to get the cooldown reduction proc.
  We're also increasing the cooldown reduction bonus from 6 to 7 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Uther is in a bit of a strange spot at the moment, as
  he has recently had a spike in his win rate, and at higher level play we've
  been seeing him flexed into the main tank role. We think it's pretty cool that
  heroes can sometimes splash into other roles, but in general Uther is
  overperforming, so we're lowering his Health a bit. On an unrelated note,
  similar to Greymane, Uther's Level 20 talents have long been dominated by one
  choice, in this case Redemption. We're giving the other talents on the tier
  some significant buffs so that they can better compete. We hope that this
  won't increase his win rate significantly as Redemption has always been a
  fairly powerful talent, and are prepared to make adjustments if this ends up
  not being the case.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are intended to limit Samuro's split-
  pushing capabilities, particularly with Illusion Master, as well as increase
  his presence in teamfights. A good Samuro player can be a bit of a pain to
  deal with, particularly when he's spending most of his time macroing and not
  engaging with the enemy team except to swap to a far away clone. These changes
  should make this scenario happen less often, while also giving Samuro more
  rewarding tools for engaging and fighting the enemy team.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Razor Swipe by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For Greymane, we're giving part of Incendiary
  Elixir's cooldown reduction bonus baseline so that the talent gives him some
  baseline power, as well as making it easier for him to complete the quest. In
  addition to this change, we're addressing his Level 20 talent diversity, which
  has not been the best. We're giving 3 of his talents significant buffs so that
  they can compete with Hunter's Blunderbuss, which has traditionally been the
  go-to option. Unleashed now makes it easier to proc Go for the Throat, as well
  as causing those procs to give him significantly more mobility and damage due
  to resetting his cooldowns. For Gilnean Roulette, we're trying the idea of the
  talent changing Cursed Bullet to be more like a 4th Basic Ability that can be
  used multiple times in a teamfight or as a potent poke tool. Finally, Tooth
  and Claw is now also turning Razor Swipe into a significant source of damage.</p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly – Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Team Leaders will now be chosen based solely on highest Rank.</strong></span></li>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong>. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong> only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just hit the Public Test Realm and will
be available for playtesting until the week of December 2, PST. As always, if
you encounter any bugs during your PTR play sessions, please stop by the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/heroes/c/ptr-bug-report">PTR
Bug Report forum</a>
to let us know about your experiences.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly – Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Toy 2 Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Toy 2 Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Generic Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Seasoned Marksman</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 60 to 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Attack Speed bonus duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since its removal on many Heroes, Seasoned Marksman
  has fallen off a bit due to needing to be tuned around so many different kits.
  Now that it has a home in fewer places, we're giving it a fairly substantial
  buff to make it more relevant.</p>

<h4 id="arthas">Arthas</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed Arthas's talents so that they appear in the same order as other Heroes [Q, W, E, etc.]</li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deathlord [Q]
<ul>
<li>No longer increases the range of Death Coil.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: If Death Coil is used on an enemy Hero, its Mana cost is refunded.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathlord has been a fairly awkward talent for a long
  time, providing Arthas with little output and utility, even when going for a Q
  build. We're changing it to now give Arthas a fairly potent Poke tool by
  making it possible for him to infinitely drain the Health of enemy Heroes over
  time if they stay near him, which should only become more powerful as he gets
  his other Q talents as the game goes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>

<blockquote>

  peers, so we're buffing it!</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Swinging giant maces is awesome. Undead skeleton
  kings are awesome. Leoric's now a little more awesome. Play him.</p>

  small buffs which should make her feel better to play.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the Mana cost of Flame Buffet from 50 to 40.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heat Exhaustion [E]
<ul>

<li><strong>Level 13</strong>

<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Flame [Trait]
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces Alexstrasza's attack speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since we made changes to
  Alexstrasza, so we did a pass and gave her some love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="brightwing">Brightwing</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Greater Polymorph [W]
<ul>
<li>No longer resets the cooldown of Polymorph on Takedowns.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: If Brightwing hits an enemy Hero with Arcane Flare's center damage while they are Polymorphed, then reduce Polymorph's cooldown by 6 seconds and gain 50 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Critical Mist [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Soothing Mist heals allied Heroes for 150. Double this healing if a disabling effect is removed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Safety Dust [E]
<ul>
<li>Bonus allied healing increased from 25% to 75%.</li>
<li>Now has a Crit kicker to show when the bonus healing is applied.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Greater Polymorph to have a more
  reliable bonus provided she can combo her Arcane Flare with Polymorph. We also
  saw an opportunity to give Critical Mist some more reliable Healing output, so
  now it will Heal her teammates regardless if she removes a status effect or
  not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="rehgar">Rehgar</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feral Heart [Z]
<ul>
<li>No longer increases Rehgar's Mana regeneration while in Ghost Form.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Ghost Wolf attacks give Rehgar 1% of his maximum Mana, quadrupled against enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We found it a little awkward that Feral Heart
  primarily motivates Rehgar to stay in Ghost Wolf form, and to not attack
  enemies or do things that are engaging for the hero. We're changing the Mana
  bonus portion of the talent to reward Rehgar for playing aggressively, and also
  allowing the talent to better synergize with other Z talents on his tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="tyrande">Tyrande</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Everlasting Light [Q]
<ul>
<li>Healing bonus increased from 45% to 60%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trueshot Aura [Active]
<ul>
<li>Active damage bonus increased from 15% to 25%.</li>

<li>Light of Elune's bonus Movement Speed increased from 15% to 20%.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eyes of the Huntress [R1]
<ul>
<li>Reveal duration increased from 2 to 10 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Celestial Wrath [R2]
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Slow from Starfall to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While powerful in the right circumstances, Tyrande
  has not been seen as much as we would like. There were a few outliers in
  Tyrande's talents in regards to their performance which we are addressing with
  these changes that should help bring her more into the meta.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unstoppable duration increased from 1 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're buffing some of Whitemane's kit to allow her to
  better compete against other Healers, and to better round out her talent tree.
  We believe the buffs to Inquisition should make it feel much better to use,
  and we're finally reducing Scarlet Aegis's cooldown (no really we are, we
  double-checked this time!), which we missed implementing with the last patch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We saw some feedback that Strike at the Heart is a
  little awkward now that it doesn't match the duration of Genji's reset window
  on Swift Strike, so we're changing it to now deal all of its damage after 1
  second. We're also changing a few of his other talents to better compete with
  their peers.</p>

<h4 id="junkrat">Junkrat</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Maximum damage reduced from 775 to 720.</li>
<li>Minimum damage reduced from 475 to 445.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has been performing very well since his
  rework. His W build is still not up to par compared to its competitors, but we
  believe it's very close, so we're slightly nerfing Sticky Wicket while also
  buffing BOOM POW since it's his lynchpin talent to make the W build come
  online. We're also nerfing the damage of RIP-Tire, as it is outperforming
  compared to Rocket Ride, as well as influencing team fights a little much,
  especially when upgraded at Level 20. We like the powerful, game-breaking
  feeling that Extra Oomph provides at Level 20 (the dream is that all talents
  at this stage of the game can feel just as epic), so we're going to hold off
  on nerfing it until we see how this change pans out.</p>

<li>Damage increased from 30 to 36.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As the information can be a bit hidden, we're re-
  evaluating where we have scaling on heroes that deviates from the normal 4%
  per level. While we have some good balance reasons for doing this, Lunara's
  Nature's Toxin was not one of them. Because of this, we're changing its
  scaling to match other heroes, which will result in a decent buff in the
  early-mid game and a very slight nerf to her in the late game. Overall this
  should be a moderate buff for her for most of the game.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing around quite a bit about Zagara, with
  a few goals in mind. Firstly, we believe we went a little far in reducing her
  power in the solo-lane, so we're increasing her Basic Attack damage, which
  will help her throughout the game in a way that enemies should always be able
  to react to and punish her accordingly if she misplays. We're also changing
  around her Level 1 talents to be more universally usable outside of PvE
  scenarios. For Zagara players who want to specialize in Sieging enemy bases,
  Infest will be the go-to talent on the tier, whereas the other talents will be
  more generally useful. Lastly, we're significantly buffing her late-game
  power, but making her Level 16 talents fairly impactful, which should help her
  scale into the late game as a competent damage dealer during team fights.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Scarlet Heist: Daily Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mobsters are back! After completing the Scarlet Heist quest line, a set of three new daily special event quests will be available.</li>
<li>Using a Special Event dialog, you can choose one of those three quests and complete it for a Scarlet Heist Chest reward, once a day, until the event ends on December 3rd, 2019, PST.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New Feature: Hero Mastery Rings</strong>
<ul>
<li>A lot of you may remember the old 'Mastery Skins' and we are excited to bring back another way for players to show off their mastery of individual Heroes. With today's patch, players will be able to spend 5,000 gold to purchase augmented Hero Rings for any Hero over the levels of 15 (Level 1) and 25 (Level 2). These Mastery Rings are permanent when purchased and will be placed over the top of the normal Hero Ring, becoming visible to all players while in a match. We are extremely excited to know what you think about these and appreciate hearing any feedback you have on them!</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="tank">Tank</h3>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2670 to 2825.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Black Soulstone [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Bonus Health reduced from 0.4% to 0.3% per Soul.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Apocalypse [R1]
<ul>
<li>Mana cost reduced from 100 to 50.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo, surprisingly, is one of the lowest winning
  Heroes in the game. That doesn't mean that he's not extremely powerful at
  times or unpopular, so we don't feel the need to make drastic changes right
  now. However, we are making a few small adjustments to make him better when
  he's behind in a game by increasing his Health until he's around 75 Souls. To
  allow Diablo to more commonly attempt to land his entire combo with
  Apocalypse, we're reducing the Mana cost. Interestingly, Apocalypse is chosen
  a lot more often, but is actually a 5% lower win rate, so we want to make the
  Heroic win more without drastically shifting the perception of its power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bruiser">Bruiser</h3>

<h4 id="artanis">Artanis</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Purifier Beam [R2]
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased from 3 to 3.2.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Movement Speed changes hurt the ability for
  Purifier Beam to stick to a target a little more than most abilities. When
  increasing Movement Speed of Heroes, we knew that Abilities would be more
  difficult to land which would require players to adjust, but Purifier Beam
  doesn't allow you to aim differently. That being said, Purifier Beam is still
  very comparable to Suppression Pulse in terms of pick rate and win rate, so we
  think a very small adjustment is in order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="rexxar">Rexxar</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Mend Pet [E]
<ul>
<li>Mana cost increased from 55 to 60.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Easy Prey [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Damage bonus against Mercenaries and Minions reduced from 200% to 150%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flare [Active]
<ul>
<li>Cast range increased from 15 to 25.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hunter-Gatherer [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Bonus Healing Regeneration reduced from 1.25 to 1 per second per Regeneration Globe.</li>
<li>Maximum stacks increased from 20 to 25.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rexxar, while a niche Hero, is overperforming
  compared to his competitors. We don't think we need to nerf him too much (in
  spite of his 57%+ win rate), but he has room for another small nudge in the
  downward direction. We're targeting a few of his Talents that are much more
  powerful than the other choices on the tier so encourage a variety of Talent
  selections too (though this is secondary to trying to provide an overall nerf
  to the Hero).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="varian">Varian</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Overpower [W]
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage increased from 30% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Taunt [R1]
<ul>
<li>Health and Health Regeneration bonuses increased from 30% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Twin Blades of Fury [R3]
<ul>
<li>Base Attack Damage reduction increased from 20% to 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lionheart [Q]
<ul>
<li>Healing bonus increased from 50% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li>Banner of Stormwind [Active]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 45 to 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Banner of Dalaran [Active]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 45 to 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Glory to the Alliance [Passive]
<ul>
<li>Banner cooldown reduction changed from 20 seconds to 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Twin Blades is outperforming compared to other
  options, so we're slightly reducing its power and increasing the power of
  Taunt to incentivize Varian players to try tanking for their team more often.
  We're also buffing a slew of under-used talents which should give Varian
  players more options to consider when deciding how to build the hero.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vampiric Rounds [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Bonus Shrike Heal from stacking 5 Doses from 1.5% to .75%.</li>
<li>Added second reward: 
<ul>
<li>Increase Shrike's Heal by .25% for every Basic Attack against Heroes that have 5 Doses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slumber Shells [E]
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Sleep Dart by 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Night Terrors [E]
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces Sleep Dart cooldown.</li>
<li>Modified functionality: Gain 25% Movement for 2 seconds for every Hero hit by Sleeping Dart. When a Hero wakes, they take 10% of their maximum Health in damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Ana was one of the Heroes most affected by the
  Movement Speed change a few patches ago. We have been waiting to see where she
  stabilized at and are ready to give her some buffs to help bring her back to
  where she should be. On top of a small baseline Healing increases, we wanted
  to remove the awkwardness of the way Vampiric Rounds asked players to
  constantly target swap after 5 Shrike stacks.</p>

<h4 id="deckard">Deckard</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Healing Potion [Q]
<ul>
<li>Now displays its impending AoE to allies while the missile is in flight.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fortitude of the Faithful [Trait]
<ul>
<li>Radius increased from 5.5 to 6.5.</li>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1/4/7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gems [Active/W]
<ul>
<li>Added functionality: Increases the damage of the unleashing Horadric Cube by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ruby [Active/W]
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Trigger radius of Lesser Healing Potions increased from .5 to 1 (matching base potions).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perfect Gems [Active/W]
<ul>
<li>Now reduces the cooldown of all Gem talents to 5 seconds, instead of a flat 25 second reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite old man is still lagging behind his
  healer friends, despite the suite of buffs he's seen in the past few patches.
  Rather than pushing his numbers even higher, we're giving him a boost to
  general usability by making his potions display their impact location before
  they land and increasing the area in which his trait will function.
  Additionally, we're giving the various gem talents a bit of damage to make
  them more attractive options overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="li-li">Li Li</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>

<li>Hindering Winds [W]
<ul>
<li>Moved to level 13.</li>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>

<ul>
<li>Moved to level 4.</li>
<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 3 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hindering Winds was a bit too effective compared to
  the other options available at level 4. Rather than nerfing it into oblivion,
  we're swapping its position with Surging Winds at level 13. This should open
  up her talent options a little bit and give us room to make further
  adjustments to the rest of her kit in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="lt-morales">Lt. Morales</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vanadium Plating [W]
<ul>
<li>New Functionality: Increases the duration of Safeguard by 1 second. While the target is Stunned or Rooted, Safeguard's armor value is increased to 50.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prolonged Safeguard [W]
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New Talent - Medi-Drone [W]
<ul>
<li>Allies with Safeguard receive 50% of the healing done by Healing Beam on other targets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Prolonged Safeguard was not a very exciting talent
  pick and its increased duration bonus was redundant against Vanadium Plating's
  duration increasing mechanic. We decided to consolidate these mechanics onto
  one talent and explore offering an entirely new mechanic for the other. This
  new replacement, Medi-Drone, gives a limited amount of multi-target healing,
  something Lt. Morales was previously lacking and often requested in your
  feedback.</p>

<li>Innervate [Trait]

<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 25 seconds.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To help Malfurion be a little more competitive with

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively listening to player feedback on
  the recent rework to Whitemane, and are making some changes to her to address
  them. Overall, her Talent Tree seems to be in a much healthier spot, and with
  the addition of some new baseline mechanics, we are hoping that she now feels
  closer to the Scarlet Inquisitor we all know and love!</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero reworks, a brand new
event, bug fixes, and more! Read on for details!</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>MacOS Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>With this patch, Heroes of the Storm will use Metal for rendering on macOS. This change ensures that Heroes is compatible with macOS Catalina and that it continues to be compatible with macOS for a long time to come. As a result, the minimum required version of macOS to run Heroes of the Storm is being increased to macOS 10.12 Sierra.</li>
<li>There are a few known issues in this release: 
<ul>
<li>Stuttering and stalling may be experienced early on in a game, particularly when the game first loads in and when the enemy team is first encountered. These stalls will get better over the course of a game and over the course of several games as macOS optimizes Heroes of the Storm behind the scenes.</li>
<li>Some outlines render black.</li>
<li>Some outlines and team color-based textures may render using colors from the color blind palette when color blind mode is disabled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We will continue to work hard to resolve these and
  any other issues as we commit to providing a quality experience for our macOS
  players.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Free Loot Chest with 30 Day Boost Promotion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Until October 22nd, receive a free Legendary Scarlet Heist Chest when you purchase a 30 day boost!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="text-warning"><s><strong>[NEW] Changed matchmaking configurations to lower wait times for most players, while tightening rules for Masters+.</strong></s></span></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-warning"><s><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have seen your feedback on matchmaking and want to
  make it better! We have updated the system to match faster for most players,
  while tightening up the rules for our higher level players. We are always
  looking for more feedback so please keep it coming!</s></span></p>

<h3 id="new-event-the-scarlet-heist">New Event: The Scarlet Heist</h3>

<p>New Tirisfal City. A town where every cop is on the take and every crook pays
their dues. From her penthouse suite atop the Scarlet Monastery Casino,
Whitemane runs the largest criminal empire this side of Tirisfal. There isn't
a deal that gets made, a job that gets pulled, a scam that gets run without
Whitemane giving her blessing and getting her cut. Until now.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Event Dates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Scarlet Heist is the fall event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of September 24 – December 3. You'll be able to equip skins for Junkrat, Orphea, Sgt. Hammer, and Whitemane, and complete quests to unlock Portraits, Sprays, Emojis, and special Mounts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Scarlet Heist event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Scarlet Heist Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Scarlet Heist Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' limited-time Fall of King's Crest event in Scarlet Heist Loot Chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Orphea's plan is simple: she grabs the safe while Junkrat brings the firepower and Bama provides the getaway. Whitemane would never expect anyone to be bold (or stupid) enough to steal from the Scarlet Mafia. And that's the best thing that Orphea's crew has going for them. As you complete quests you will unlock rewards and if you can pull off the heist you'll unlock the Royal Getaway Sidecar mount.</li>

<ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Talk about fireworks?! With our last balance patch,
  we introduced some changes to Shadow Fissure that ended up causing a bit more
  mayhem than we had expected. While we like rewarding players for hitting their
  abilities, a full instant reset of the ability ended up feeling pretty bad to
  play against in a lot of circumstances. This was compounded with the changes
  we also made to Might of the Scourge, so instead of a full reset, we decided
  to dial it back a notch and set the cooldown to 1.5 seconds instead.</p>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just hit the Public Test Realm and will
be available for playtesting until the week of September 23rd. As always, if

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>MacOS Update:</strong>
<ul>
<li>With this patch, Heroes of the Storm will use Metal for rendering on macOS. This change ensures that Heroes is compatible with macOS Catalina and that it continues to be compatible with macOS for a long time to come. As a result, the minimum required version of macOS to run Heroes of the Storm is being increased to macOS 10.12 Sierra</li>
<li>There are a few known issues in this release:
<ul>
<li>Stuttering and stalling may be experienced early on in a game, particularly when the game first loads in and when the enemy team is first encountered. These stalls will get better over the course of a game and over the course of several games as macOS optimizes Heroes of the Storm behind the scenes</li>
<li>Some outlines render black</li>
<li>Some outlines and team color-based textures may render using colors from the color blind palette when color blind mode is disabled</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We will continue to work hard to resolve these and
  any other issues as we commit to providing a quality experience for our macOS
  players.</p>

<h2 id="new-event-the-scarlet-heist">New Event: The Scarlet Heist</h2>

<p>New Tirisfal City. A town where every cop is on the take and every crook pays
their dues. From her penthouse suite atop the Scarlet Monastery Casino,
Whitemane runs the largest criminal empire this side of Tirisfal. There isn't
a deal that gets made, a job that gets pulled, a scam that gets run without
Whitemane giving her blessing and getting her cut. Until now.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Event Dates</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Scarlet Heist is the fall event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of September 24 – December 3. You'll be able to equip skins for Junkrat, Orphea, Sgt. Hammer, and Whitemane, and complete quests to unlock Portraits, Sprays, Emojis, and special Mounts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Scarlet Heist event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Scarlet Heist Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Scarlet Heist Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' limited-time Fall of King's Crest event in Scarlet Heist Loot Chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scarlet Heist Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Orphea's plan is simple: she grabs the safe while Junkrat brings the firepower and Bama provides the getaway. Whitemane would never expect anyone to be bold (or stupid) enough to steal from the Scarlet Mafia. And that's the best thing that Orphea's crew has going for them. As you complete quests you will unlock rewards and if you can pull off the heist you'll unlock the Royal Getaway Sidecar mount.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shadow Fissure [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hitting an enemy Hero no longer instantly resets the cooldown of Shadow Fissure, but instead sets it to 1.5 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Talk about fireworks?! With our last balance patch,
  we introduced some changes to Shadow Fissure that ended up causing a bit more
  mayhem than we had expected. While we like rewarding players for hitting their
  abilities, a full instant reset of the ability ended up feeling pretty bad to
  play against in a lot of circumstances. This was compounded with the changes
  we also made to Might of the Scourge, so instead of a full reset, we decided
  to dial it back a notch and set the cooldown to 1.5 seconds instead.</p>
