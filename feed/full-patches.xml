<h3 id="tank">Tank</h3>

<h4 id="blaze">Blaze</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flame Stream [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additionality functionality: Hitting an enemy with both streams of Flame Stream deals 120 damage. This additional hit triggers Flame Stream's Pyromania cooldown reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Habits [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pyromania cooldown reduction from Regeneration Globes reduced from 8 to 6 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossfire [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Suppressive Fire [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nanomachine Coating [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fuel Leak [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grill and Kill [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 7.</li>
<li>Changed functionality: Ignited Oil Spill damage bonus now granted instantly.</li>
<li>Ignited Oil Spill damage bonus increased from 35% to 45%.</li>
<li>Hero hits for quest completion reduced from 60 to 30.</li>
<li>Quest Reward Ignite duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adhesive Petroleum [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 7.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemies standing in Oil Spill when its Ignited take 35% more Basic Attack damage from Blaze for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>(New) Collision Course [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Jet Propulsion deals an additional 325 damage to its collision target.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Crossfire has always been a wildly popular talent, so
  we're bringing it baseline. With this early addition of damage, we're
  comfortable pushing back his damage talent tier and swapping it with his
  impactful tanking talents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4 id="garrosh">Garrosh</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Into the Fray [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 7.</li>
<li>Armor reduced from 25 to 20.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intimidation [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack Speed reduction reduced from 40% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Oppressor [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Changed from a Passive talent to a Bloodthirst [W] talent.</li>
<li>Spell Power reduction reduced from 40% to 30%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Bloodthirst also applies the Spell Power reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>(New) Lok-tar Ogar! [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increase Into the Fray Armor by 20.</li>
<li>Into the Fray's cooldown is reduced by 12 seconds for each enemy Hero hit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Into the Fray has become a crucial part of what is
  expected from Garrosh, so we're just giving in to the mad Warchief. We're also
  mildly lowering the power of his level 7 talents to make up for this addition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4 id="johanna">Johanna</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Iron Skin [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield increased from 674 to 810.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold Your Ground [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield percent increase reduced from 60% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sins Exposed [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduction increased from 25% to 35%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Steed Charge [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Sword [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage Increased from 150 to 225.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Fury [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodic damage increased from 12 to 15.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hold Your Ground's talent tier has some competitive
  options, but it still feels more necessary than we'd like. We're baking in
  some of its benefit, and those who love the talent will still have its current
  power - Hold Your Ground's shield is increasing from 1078.4 to 1134. Johanna
  has landed fairly well, so we're also lightly helping some of her weaker
  talents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4 id="muradin">Muradin</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Storm Bolt [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: No longer has a baseline Quest. Upon reaching level 10, Storm Bolt pierces an additional target. Basic Attacks reduce the Cooldown of Storm Bolt by 1 second and restore 3 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect Storm [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: 
<ul>
<li>Quest: Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes increase Storm Bolt's damage by .5.</li>
<li>Quest: If an enemy Hero is killed within 3 seconds of being hit by a Storm Bolt, increase Storm Bolt's damage by 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have never been really happy with Storm Bolt
  having a baseline quest as it causes players to play sub-optimally during the
  early portions of the game while stacking. Instead of removing the power of
  it, we have decided to automatically unlock its functionality when Muradin
  hits level 10. Alongside this change, we also took the opportunity to redesign
  Perfect Storm to reward both aggression and the proper use of Storm Bolt.</p>

<h4 id="stitches">Stitches</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vile Gas [D]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Playtime! [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slam Inner Area cooldown reduction increased from 1 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vile Cleaver [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Slam applies Vile Gas to all targets hit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tenderizer [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduced from 2% to 1.75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serrated Edge [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hook cooldown reduction reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Putrefaction [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduction increased from 30% to 40%.</li>
<li>Vile Gas healing increased from 60% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meat Hook [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing per second reduced from 5% to 4%.</li>
<li>Duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chop Chop [Q/Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Attack Speed bonus reduced from 50% to 40%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Basic Attacks against Heroes refresh the duration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digestive Juices [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Devour cooldown reduction reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Damage reduction duration reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hungry Hungry Stitches [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Heroes are Slowed by 75% for 1 second after Gorge ends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Master Hooker [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hook cooldown reduction reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Healing reduction reduced from 100% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Stitches is successfully lumbering his way through
  the Nexus in his own way – with a massive health pool and lots of healing. We
  think a small reduction on both ends will be healthy without tripping him up.
  We're also reducing his Hook cooldown reduction on both Serrated Edge and
  Master Hooker, so Stitches will have to work harder to play with his food.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Descending from the Heavens restores Imperius for 30% of his maximum Health and Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Flash of Anger has overshadowed Imperius' other level
  7 talents for a while, as it was the premier option for both AoE damage and
  survivability. With buffs to both Blaze of Glory and Holy Fervor, along with a
  sizable increase in base power, we hope to see more Imperius action.</p>

  have asked for Inner Focus, so we're returning it with a slightly different
  flavor – please let us know how this feels to play with.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Stukov had a couple of fun talents that were being
  overshadowed by stronger and/or more synergistic ones. We didn't want to lose
  their flavor, so we baked their current functionality into existing talents
  that were in need of a little love themselves.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Jimmy ain't fought his last battle yet. We're
  returning Ace in the Hole to its original functionality, mostly in response to
  player sentiment, but also to open up a Basic Attack build that isn't Gambit
  dependent. As always, thanks for your feedback! We have decided to remove
  Execute Orders from ARAMs, as we think even a less powerful version is still
  not healthy for the game mode.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning">Experience Globes will no longer time out after 6 seconds. Instead, they will shrink and become worth 25% of their original value for an additional 39 seconds.</span></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are continuously looking for gameplay changes that
  make the game more fun while also educating the player base. This change does
  both - giving teams that missed the crucial 6 second timing window a chance
  for partial redemption while, at the same time, showing players where they are
  missing valuable experience via lane soaking. The team has been enjoying how
  this plays internally and are eager to hear your feedback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Search Term Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are constantly looking for ways of improving the
  player experience. This update should help players in Storm League find whom
  they are looking for. Common terms across the MOBA Genre have been added to
  many heroes allowing players to search for things like Double Soak, Sustain,
  Escape, Camps, Burst, Mage, Stun, CC, etc. Please give the ones listed a try
  and others you may think of. You may find it comes up with something you
  expect. Remember that if you need an alphabetical return you will need to have
  the Alphabetical flag turned on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite large lad is back and hungrier than
  ever! We're giving our best beefy boi a new baseline ability called Shambling
  Horror that should help him saunter in and out of combat a bit more
  consistently. This ability, combined with a plethora of new and reworked
  talents, should make his immediate presence more dangerous. We've also decided
  to bake in the benefits of the old Fishing Hook talent at level 13. This
  talent was simply too fun and effective to the point where it became
  impossible to design reasonable alternatives. We hope the totality of these
  changes will breathe new un-life into a Hero that has fallen out of favor over
  the years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan's PvE-centric talents are proving a little
  stronger than we'd like for how easy they are to execute on, so we're shaving
  off a little bit of power across the board and greatly reducing the cast range
  of Demonic Invasion. We're also normalizing Globe of Annihilation's level
  scaling since his Q builds are underperforming at most levels of play.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Falstad's last changes have certainly shocked the

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tassadar's Q build is underperforming at higher
  levels of play, so we're bumping him up slightly in that regard. The reduction
  in channel duration doesn't change how quickly the beam begins to travel, and
  instead just allows Tassadar to act sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Search Term Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are constantly looking for ways of improving the
  player experience. This update should help players in Storm League find whom
  they are looking for. Common terms across the MOBA Genre have been added to
  many heroes allowing players to search for things like Double Soak, Sustain,
  Escape, Camps, Burst, Mage, Stun, CC, etc. Please give the ones listed a try
  and others you may think of. You may find it comes up with something you
  expect. Remember that if you need an alphabetical return you will need to have
  the Alphabetical flag turned on.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Jimmy had a pretty large overhaul a while back,

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite large lad is back and hungrier than
  ever! We're giving our best beefy boi a new baseline ability called Shambling
  Horror that should help him saunter in and out of combat a bit more
  consistently. This ability, combined with a plethora of new and reworked
  talents, should make his immediate presence more dangerous. We've also decided
  to bake in the benefits of the old Fishing Hook talent at level 13. This
  talent was simply too fun and effective to the point where it became
  impossible to design reasonable alternatives. We hope the totality of these
  changes will breathe new un-life into a Hero that has fallen out of favor over
  the years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We don't dislike Uther being capable of playing a
  frontline role, but we do believe he's doing so a little too freely. This

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan's PvE-centric talents are proving a little
  stronger than we'd like for how easy they are to execute on, so we're shaving
  off a little bit of power across the board and greatly reducing the cast range
  of Demonic Invasion. We're also normalizing Globe of Annihilation's level
  scaling since his Q builds are underperforming at most levels of play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tassadar's Q build is underperforming at higher
  levels of play, so we're bumping him up slightly in that regard. The reduction
  in channel duration doesn't change how quickly the beam begins to travel, and
  instead just allows Tassadar to act sooner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with the Lord of Terror's ability to wage
  wanton destruction, but we think he should do so at greater risk to himself.
  The hits to his survivability may be too heavy handed, in which case we are
  ready to grovel for Diablo's forgiveness and resolve it with our next update.
  While we're here, we had an excuse to tune up Fire Stomp's later tier talents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mal'Ganis has fallen off the list of tanks that are
  considered when drafting, and we hope this lift upwards leaves him on more
  solid footing. We also looked to level out the benefit from some
  underperforming talents, in particular Time to Feed now always heals for 80%
  of its previously conditional amount, and has a new bonus for Sleeping
  enemies. That said, Blood Rush has had a mild reduction in duration that
  should not be noticed while fighting, but will increase how often it is reset
  between scuffles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Muradin has spent a long time being a consistent
  Tank, and has slowly drifted upwards in power. Sharpening Bronzebeard Rage

  We didn't like how mandatory the old Hindering Winds talent felt, so we made
  some of its functionality baseline and repositioned some Blinding Wind talents
  to make her 'offensive' build more potent. We've also redesigned many of Li
  Li's Cloud Serpent talents to make them more individually meaningful and to
  make the collective Cloud Serpent build have more of an identity and purpose

<ul>
<li><strong>Nanomachine Coating [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 2.5 to 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While in a relatively good place, many of Blaze's
  talent tiers have one or two talents that are heavily picked over the third.
  We're trying to shore up the alternate picks to be more competitive, which
  should lead to more unique ways to play the Firebat.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Snow Blind [Q]</strong>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ice Storm [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus final Stun damage increased from 125% to 150%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slushball [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage increased from 50% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cold Front [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Icing by 4 seconds. If Mei enters her own Blizzard while Icing is active, the cooldown of Icing is reduced by 5 seconds and she gains 80 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Flurry [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 100% to 125%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mei has a few talent issues and hasn't been seen in
  the tank meta recently, so we're giving her some buffs, particularly to
  various talents that aren't seeing as much play as they should.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bunny Hop [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 52 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> D.Va's a very unique Hero due to her ability to go in
  and out of her Mech to survive in situations where other Heroes would perish.
  When she's too tanky, she can be overly frustrating due to having to "die"
  twice in order for the enemy team to remove her from the map. We think she's a
  little too beefy in this regard right now, so we're lowering her Mech
  survivability. We're also buffing Bunny Hop's damage so that it better
  competes with Micro Missiles.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Superior Schematics [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus range reduced from 50% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Gazlowe is still a little too strong and is seeing an
  overly high participation rate. To tone down his power we're lowering his
  Xplodium Charge damage and reducing the power of some of his highest
  performing talents.</p>

<ul>
<li>Damage bonus increased from 40% to 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hogger's release has been incredibly interesting. He
  started low, but his win rate has climbed significantly while perception of
  his potential power also continues to improve. We're looking to do a mix of
  buffs and nerfs to him to largely address looming talent issues while also
  keeping his overall power in check.</p>

<h4 id="imperius">Imperius</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Shield amount reduced from 1000 to 850.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The Angel of Valor was shrugging off enemy damage too
  easily while dishing out too much of his own, and the other Bruisers were
  getting jealous.</p>

<li><strong>Molten Power [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: If Living Meteor hits enemy Heroes at least 5 times, then reduce its cooldown by 7 seconds, and refund 30 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We didn't love how Molten Power's strength was
  offered in an upcoming cast after meeting its conditions. This version should
  give a more immediate reward, while also being more attractive for solo
  laners.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: If Holy Word: Salvation lasts for its full duration, then reduce its cooldown by 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Desperate Prayer [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 40 to 30 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're experimenting with a change to Light of
  Stormwind to allow for Anduin to have higher highs when using Holy Word:
  Salvation to its full potential. When he gets a full cast off he will now have
  a greatly reduced cooldown, allowing it to be used multiple times in a single
  fight.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>

<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Detainment Strike Slows enemy Heroes for 20% for 2.5 seconds. Slow and duration doubled on enemies it Stuns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Heavy Burden wasn't keeping Auriel as safe as it
  should, especially when compared to Repeated Offense, and we want it to be a
  dependable option.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Dust [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Pixie Dust duration by 1 second. Soothing Mist and Blink Heal heal allies with an active Pixie Dust for 75% more.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We liked how Safety Dust boosted all of Brightwing's
  healing tools. However, its healing was overflowing when paired with Phase
  Shift and Hyper Shift, and not in a way we consider exciting. We believe this
  change keeps the core of what makes Safety Dust fun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We did a pass on Lucio and found some places where we
  could make his talents more interesting and fun. We're particularly interested
  to see how our change to High Five working on Lucio helps with his ability to
  keep both himself and his teammates alive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Some of Stukov's talents have been too inconsistent
  to be considered viable, so we're making some small buffs to them in order to
  increase their competitiveness. We're also reducing the strength of some of
  his overperforming talents to keep his overall power in check.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We were too scared of Queen of Blades being too

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Horrify to no longer be able to be
  interrupted during its cast. It was never intended to have a long cast time,
  and due to its unique setup we've had a lot of bug reports over the years due
  to it being interrupted and being put in a 10-second cooldown, but its sound
  still going off. This change should fix the issue and get rid of the
  confusion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Light tuning to level out Zul'jin talent tiers gave
  us an opportunity for some extra love. It's hard to feel Recklessness'
  benefits as Zul'jin's health lowers so extra quest credit might help it get
  noticed. The consistency of Eye of Zul'jin was hard to beat at Level 13, so
  we've targeted these changes to help Lacerate and Ensnare be more reliable.
  We're comfortable with No Mercy! being a more niche option in response to
  enemy Hero compositions, but it wasn't as strong as it should be even in those
  situations.</p>

<h3 id="new-hero-hogger-scourge-of-elwynn">New Hero: Hogger, Scourge of Elwynn</h3>

<p>Hogger, a chaotic, mobile, bruiser who creates terrain and deals heavy area
damage, now joins the battle in the Nexus!</p>

<p><strong>Trait [D]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Hoard</strong>
<ul>
<li>Throw a pile of junk that deals 102 damage in a small area and acts as terrain for 5 seconds. Upon expiration, a scrap of Meat is dislodged from the Hoard that Hogger can collect to restore 3% of his maximum Health every second for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trait [Passive]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rage is gained by taking damage or dealing Basic Attack damage. Hogger's Basic Ability cooldowns refresh 1% faster for every 2 points of Rage. After 3 seconds of not gaining Rage, it begins to quickly decay.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staggering Blow [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Swing your chain in a wide arc, dealing 140 damage to enemies hit and knocking them away. If an enemy collides with terrain, they are dealt an additional 150 damage, Stunned for .75 seconds, and grant Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 12 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ez-Thro Dynamite [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toss a boot full of Dynamite with a 1.5 second fuse. Upon detonation, enemies take 180 damage and are Slowed by 30% for 2 seconds. The Dynamite instantly detonates when landing directly on an enemy Hero and grants Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hogg Wild [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .25 seconds, become Unstoppable and uncontrollably spin towards the targeted direction, ricocheting off any terrain encountered. Every .25 seconds, deal 36 damage to nearby enemies, increased by 1% for each current point of Rage. Ricocheting off terrain refreshes the duration of the spin.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 14 seconds.</li>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>No longer deals damage to Structures.</strong></span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hoardapult [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Launch an empowered Loot Hoard with Hogger attached, dealing 140 damage and Slowing enemies by 50% for 2 seconds. Hoardapult's Loot Hoard lasts for up to 20 seconds, but decays rapidly while Hogger isn't nearby. Every 10 seconds Hogger can take a chunk of Meat from the Loot Hoard.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shockwave [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .5 seconds, slam the ground, sending out a shockwave that travels in a long line. Enemies hit by the initial slam take 306 damage and are Stunned for 1.25 seconds. Enemies only hit by the shockwave take 210 damage and are Stunned for .75 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 70 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journeyman Cooking [W]</strong>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly">Nexus Anomaly</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <br />
  Hello fellow Heroes!  </p>
  
  <p>We've decided to remove our last Seasonal Nexus Anomaly, the Gladiator's
  Medallion. While there were many things that we both did and did not like with
  this experimental change, it wasn't a clear enough win for us to keep it going
  forward.  </p>
  
  <p>We liked how the Medallion gave players some agency over countering CC chains,
  and how it added a new vector of skill expression that was universally
  available to everyone who played the game, no matter which hero or role they
  played as.  </p>
  
  <p>However, over time, we felt that, as a whole, the Medallion took away from
  cool plays more than it added them to the game. Setting up combos with
  teammates is a large part of what makes Heroes of the Storm exciting to both
  play and watch, and having 5 possible instances every 5 minutes of these plays
  not working anymore was taking away a bit too much from the game. We had tried
  some other iterations of the Medallion internally to solve this exact problem,
  such as only having it available once per game for each player, but found that
  lowering the frequency too much led to Medallions only being used during the
  last fight, which ended up not hitting the mark for a new feature that should
  made the game better as a whole.  </p>
  
  <p>Despite the issues we have with the Medallion, we believe the idea still has
  some promise, so you may see some more experimentation in the future. We also
  wanted to remind you that we will not be doing seasonal Nexus Anomalies going
  forward. We will, however, continue to iterate and pursue other ways to
  improve Heroes of the Storm, and will release those updates when we feel they
  are ready. As always, thank you so much for playing this game that we all
  love.</p>

<h3 id="new-hero-hogger-scourge-of-elwynn">New Hero: Hogger, Scourge of Elwynn</h3>

<p>Hogger, a chaotic, mobile, bruiser who creates terrain and deals heavy area
damage, now joins the battle in the Nexus!</p>

<p><strong>Trait [D]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Hoard</strong>
<ul>
<li>Throw a pile of junk that deals 102 damage in a small area and acts as terrain for 5 seconds. Upon expiration, a scrap of Meat is dislodged from the Hoard that Hogger can collect to restore 3% of his maximum Health every second for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trait [Passive]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rage is gained by taking damage or dealing Basic Attack damage. Hogger's Basic Ability cooldowns refresh 1% faster for every 2 points of Rage. After 3 seconds of not gaining Rage, it begins to quickly decay.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staggering Blow [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Swing your chain in a wide arc, dealing 140 damage to enemies hit and knocking them away. If an enemy collides with terrain, they are dealt an additional 150 damage, Stunned for .75 seconds, and grant Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 12 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ez-Thro Dynamite [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toss a boot full of Dynamite with a 1.5 second fuse. Upon detonation, enemies take 180 damage and are Slowed by 30% for 2 seconds. The Dynamite instantly detonates when landing directly on an enemy Hero and grants Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hogg Wild [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .25 seconds, become Unstoppable and uncontrollably spin towards the targeted direction, ricocheting off any terrain encountered. Every .25 seconds, deal 36 damage to nearby enemies, increased by 1% for each current point of Rage. Ricocheting off terrain refreshes the duration of the spin.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 14 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hoardapult [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Launch an empowered Loot Hoard with Hogger attached, dealing 140 damage and Slowing enemies by 50% for 2 seconds. Hoardapult's Loot Hoard lasts for up to 20 seconds, but decays rapidly while Hogger isn't nearby. Every 10 seconds Hogger can take a chunk of Meat from the Loot Hoard.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shockwave [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .5 seconds, slam the ground, sending out a shockwave that travels in a long line. Enemies hit by the initial slam take 306 damage and are Stunned for 1.25 seconds. Enemies only hit by the shockwave take 210 damage and are Stunned for .75 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 70 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talent</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journeyman Cooking [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Quest: Hitting an enemy Hero with Ez-Thro Dynamite restores 6% of Hogger's maximum Health and permanently increases Hogger's Health by 10, to a maximum of 750 bonus Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bones to Gnaw [Trait]</strong>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>On The Prowl [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Activate to gain 30 Rage over 8 seconds. Passive: Hogger heals for 6 Health every second, increased by 2% for each point of Rage he has.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brute Strength [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increase the range of Loot Hoard by 15%. Each Hero hit by Staggering Blow will permanently increase Hogger's Basic Attack damage by 1, up to 100 bonus damage. Terrain collision impacts grant 2 stacks of this effect.</li>

<li><strong>Aggro Range [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increase Hogg Wild's area by 25% and generate 1 Rage per enemy hit, increased to 3 against Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>While at or above 30 Rage, Hogger gains 10% increased Movement Speed and healing received. When above 50 Rage, increase these bonuses to 15%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeing Red [Q/E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>While above 50 Rage, Staggering Blow and Hogg Wild's cooldowns refresh 30% faster and Hogger gains 25% increased Attack Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dense Blasting Powder [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Direct hits launch an additional stack of dynamite beyond the target. Hitting an Ez-Thro Dynamite with Staggering Blow launches 3 sticks of Dynamite.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly">Nexus Anomaly</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <br />
  Hello fellow Heroes!  </p>
  
  <p>We've decided to remove our last Seasonal Nexus Anomaly, the Gladiator's
  Medallion. While there were many things that we both did and did not like with
  this experimental change, it wasn't a clear enough win for us to keep it going
  forward.  </p>
  
  <p>We liked how the Medallion gave players some agency over countering CC chains,
  and how it added a new vector of skill expression that was universally
  available to everyone who played the game, no matter which hero or role they
  played as.  </p>
  
  <p>However, over time, we felt that, as a whole, the Medallion took away from
  cool plays more than it added them to the game. Setting up combos with
  teammates is a large part of what makes Heroes of the Storm exciting to both
  play and watch, and having 5 possible instances every 5 minutes of these plays
  not working anymore was taking away a bit too much from the game. We had tried
  some other iterations of the Medallion internally to solve this exact problem,
  such as only having it available once per game for each player, but found that
  lowering the frequency too much led to Medallions only being used during the
  last fight, which ended up not hitting the mark for a new feature that should
  made the game better as a whole.  </p>
  
  <p>Despite the issues we have with the Medallion, we believe the idea still has
  some promise, so you may see some more experimentation in the future. We also
  wanted to remind you that we will not be doing seasonal Nexus Anomalies going
  forward. We will, however, continue to iterate and pursue other ways to
  improve Heroes of the Storm, and will release those updates when we feel they
  are ready. As always, thank you so much for playing this game that we all
  love.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Warhead Junction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Layout Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sewage Tunnels have been added to the top and bottom of the Battleground.</li>
<li>The bottom one has replaced the Junk Swarm Host.</li>
<li>An additional Sight Tower has been added below mid lane.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since the release of the Battleground, we have been
  hearing two resounding pieces of feedback: the map is very large and teams
  find it difficult to engage with each other due to the amount of ground needed
  to cover while picking up Warheads, and very often the game either ends up
  being a base-race as each team takes a Junk Swarm Host and tries to push
  opposite lanes to end fastest. To address this we have added a couple of
  Sewage Tunnels (think teleporters) to the map, one of which replaces the
  bottom Junk Swarm Host, and added an additional Sight Tower to allow teams to
  keep an eye on the bottom tunnel. We feel like these changes have been a
  breath of fresh air for Warhead Junction and are excited to hear your
  feedback!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to Anub'arak's Level 20
  talents to make them feel more heroic to take. Currently Rewind is dominating
  this tier due to being both very powerful on its own and fitting Anub'arak's
  kit in a great way. We like this and don't want to take away from it, so we're
  looking to make his other choices also feel great when picked.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Over the years we've nerfed heroes like Dehaka quite
  a bit due to how effective players became at utilizing the power of their

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We saw some feedback that Azmodan's All Shall Burn
  felt awkward due to not getting various procs if the target dies while he is
  channeling on them. This was initially intended by us due to concerns of it
  being too powerful and resulting in some strange moments when playing against
  it, but we've since come around and agree the lack of usability is hurting
  these talents and Azmodan as a whole more than it's helping, so we're going to

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we updated Falstad, so we
  took a look at him and saw a few talents that could be improved. In general
  many of his talent tiers have two choices that players seem to heavily prefer
  over the third option, so we're trying to create a larger incentive for

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some functionality changes to some of
  Lunara's talents, particularly when it comes to her Q build, with the aim of
  making their benefits more easily accessible. We're also giving a small range
  increase to Lunara's Basic Attacks to Starwood Spear as a baseline buff for
  picking the talent. While we know the range increase is small, we are nervous
  about giving too much of a range increase to a Hero who has a Movement Speed
  bonus as a baseline feature of the character, so we'll be keeping an eye on
  this buff and will increase the bonus more if we feel it is appropriate.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We anticipated that Tychus's early game talents would
  have a shake-up with how much power we added to them, but we had a bit of an
  oversight with Quarterback. While moving a talent from Level 7 to Level 1
  would seem competitive in and of itself, the power we added to its
  alternatives caused the talent to be overshadowed, so we're adding some more
  beef to it and to the W build in general to make it more of a compelling way
  to build Tychus.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on

<ul>
<li>Both The Lost Vikings and Leoric are flooding our RISK team with intentional feeding false positives. To keep ARAM as healthy as possible we are temporarily removing them from the mode.</li>
<li><strong>Map</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep damage to enemy Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've given our tower changes some time to settle,
  and while we like how their current targeting mechanism works, we believe we
  went a little too far in lowering their damage. We're giving them some of
  their teeth back so that enemies who tower dive have a little less time to
  hang around in their opponent's base before they have to disengage.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Healing Fountains</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health and Shield values swapped. The Shield value now accounts for 75% of the total Health.</li>
<li>Shield regeneration rate increased to 10% of total Shields per second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players dislike how their
  Healing Fountains can be sniped by the opposing team early in the game. While
  we agree that this can be frustrating, we don't want to completely remove
  alternative strategies for creating an advantage. We're experimenting with a
  change to move the total Health of the Healing Fountains to be much more in
  favor of a Shield that quickly regenerates instead of Health. This should make
  it riskier for players to snipe Healing Fountains, as they will not get any
  value unless they destroy the building, while also rewarding players who are
  able to protect their Healing Fountains early in the game.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we like the somewhat chaotic, raid-boss feel of
  Enraged Regeneration and its healing debuff, we believe its duration is too
  long for how often the debuff can be applied to enemies, particularly at later
  stages of the game due to its synergies with talents like Twilight Nova.
  Because of this, we're heavily reducing its duration so that enemy Healers
  have larger windows of opportunity to play around its debuff.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo has recently risen in the ranks to once again

  good place, but we want to fix a design issue where Diabolical Momentum is
  simply too good at doing everything since it has synergy with all of his other

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Currently, particularly at higher levels of play,

  buff to Worldbreaker form makes more sense for Deathwing, as he is naturally
  more incentivized to use Molten Flame in this form after using his other
  abilities to control opponents' movements in choke points, but would often
  find himself unable to use Molten Flame as often due to being at low energy
  after using his other abilities to set it up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We saw some feedback that Unspeakable Horror is a
  little bit awkward to use since it doesn't Silence players while they are
  Rooted by Durance of Hate. We agreed and saw an opportunity to do a few other
  changes while we looked at him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For the most part Sylvanas has fairly good talent
  diversity, but we wanted to tinker a little bit to make it better. Her heroics
  have the least talent parity in her tree, so we're experimenting with giving
  Mind Control a simple buff that should help in its role at finding a single,
  vulnerable target to kill.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Plasma Shield is simply a little too good at giving
  Tassadar survivability, which is an intended weakness of the hero since he
  brings so many other things to the table. We're reducing its power as well as
  buffing Black Hole and its Level 20 Mastery, Kugelblitz.</p>

  him a much more exciting and fun Hero to play.</p>

<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Gladiator's Medallion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes now start the game with a new item on their action bar <span class="text-warning">in slot 6</span>, the Gladiator's Medallion.</li>
<li>The Gladiator's Medallion can be activated to become Unstoppable for 1 second.</li>
<li>The cooldown is 300 seconds (5 minutes).</li>

<li>All 3 of The Lost Vikings gain the effect of the Medallion when activated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goal for the Gladiator's Medallion is to give players more opportunities to commit to aggressive plays and relieve some of the helplessness felt when players get stuck in long CC chains.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Introducing ARAM Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>With the Patch H.52, we're replacing Heroes Brawl mode with the new ARAM - All Random All Mid mode.</li>
<li><strong>ARAM mode key features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The map pool for ARAM mode consists of four one-lane maps.</li>
<li>There are no additional objectives on the ARAM maps: destroy the enemy's Core to win.</li>
<li>As match starts, every player must pick one out of three randomly selected heroes. Think fast: you have only 30 seconds!</li>
<li>Hearthstones are disabled, and starting area does not regenerate health.</li>
<li>Unlike Heroes Brawl, there's no dedicated Weekly Quest exclusive to this mode. Instead, ARAM games contribute to Daily Quests and Special Event Quests progress.</li>

<p>Seasonal Quest Line win requirements have been reduced in Season 4.</p>

<li><strong>Steps and Rewards in Season 4 of 2020</strong>
<ul>
<li>5 Wins: Craft Wars Chest</li>
<li>10 Wins: Rare Craft Wars Chest</li>
<li>20 Wins: Epic Craft Wars Chest</li>

<ul>
<li>The final reward of the 2020 Season 4 Questline will be the Tamed Ravasaur Mount, which will be awarded after winning 35 games in Ranked Play.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Upon reviewing the time commitment required on average for players to obtain seasonal quest rewards, we've made the decision to lower the requirements from 50 games to 35 games. We believe the lowering of this requirement should help Storm League to be more approachable to a larger portion of players, as they will not have to devote as much time each season to obtain their rewards.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Alarak has fallen off a bit due to a few rounds of nerfs that have happened to him over time. We're giving him back some power via his general survivability as well the initial damage bonus that Negatively Charged gives when taking the talent.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Surge of Light continues to dominate Cassia's Level 7 talents, and has become a prime reason to take the hero.

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our goal with Chromie's recent changes was to present a viable alternative to Once Again the First Time, which we succeeded at a little too well.

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> At long last, our favorite Pro Gamer is back and ready to pwn teh n00bs! With D.Va's rework we've given her tons of new tools and redistributed her power to help her fill more of a traditional bruiser role while still retaining a lot of her "supporty" essence. This new talent tree should allow her to flex to fill gaps in your team comp or to be her old aggro self. Her old Heroic option, Big Shot, is now baseline and has been replaced with Micro Missiles, giving her Mech some reach and soft CC that she didn't have before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our resident one man wrecking crew is receiving a fairly large revamp, designed to fully embrace him as a formidable Bruiser, acting as a front-line member of his team who specializes in disruption and zone control. He now sports a new resource system with Scrap, as well as some design changes to both Deth Lazor and Xplodium Charge, which should make them more consistently useful throughout the course of the game. We had a blast tinkering with our favorite Goblin, and hope you also enjoy what we've done with him!</p>

<ul>
<li>The map pool for ARAM mode consists of four one-lane maps.</li>
<li>There are no additional objectives on the ARAM maps: destroy the enemy's Core to win.</li>

<li>Hearthstones are disabled, and starting area does not regenerate health.</li>
<li>Unlike Heroes Brawl, there's no dedicated Weekly Quest exclusive to this mode. Instead, ARAM games contribute to Daily Quests and Special Event Quests progress.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Upon reviewing the time commitment required on
  average for players to obtain seasonal quest rewards, we've made the decision
  to lower the requirements from 50 games to 35 games. We believe the lowering
  of this requirement should help Storm League to be more approachable to a
  larger portion of players, as they will not have to devote as much time each
  season to obtain their rewards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> At long last, our favorite Pro Gamer is back and
  ready to pwn teh n00bs! With D.Va's rework we've given her tons of new tools
  and redistributed her power to help her fill more of a traditional bruiser
  role while still retaining a lot of her "supporty" essence. This new talent
  tree should allow her to flex to fill gaps in your team comp or to be her old
  aggro self. Her old Heroic option, Big Shot, is now baseline and has been
  replaced with Micro Missiles, giving her Mech some reach and soft CC that she
  didn't have before.</p>

  design changes to both Deth Lazor and Xplodium Charge, which should make them
  more consistently useful throughout the course of the game. We had a blast
  tinkering with our favorite Goblin, and hope you also enjoy what we've done
  with him!</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last round of buffs have done a lot to bring

<li>New functionality: Increase Movement Speed by 10%. Frozen Tempest's maximum Slow and Attack Speed Slow increased from 40% to 60%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Howling Blast has been the same for a very long time,
  almost since the inception of our game. Many things have changed since then,
  and we believe a range increase is warranted due to how average ranges of
  various abilities and effects have changed since that time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we achieved our previous goal of making
  Incinerator Gauntlets a powerful PvE option, we overshot a bit and are
  reducing its power to be more in line with what other Warriors can bring to
  the table in this area.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encore [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemy Heroes knocked back by Face Melt or the Amp reduce E.T.C.'s Heroic cooldown by 8%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crowd Pleaser [R2]</strong>

<li>No longer reduces the cooldown of Stage Dive.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Slow amount of Stage Dive by 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We were a little hesitant to make talent changes to
  E.T.C. due to how well he has been performing, even though we felt he could
  use some help in that department. We don't believe that holding off
  indefinitely on needed talent improvements just because a Hero is performing
  well serves our Heroes in the best way over the long term, so we're making
  these improvements and will adjust accordingly once we see how they settle.</p>

<li>​<strong>Flurry [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown refresh rate increased from 75% to 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are super happy with where Mei is sitting overall,
  but wanted to continue tuning some talents to help even things out. While
  doing so, we also increased the cooldown of Avalanche substantially, as it
  feels like she has too much up-time on its availability in team fights.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It was not our intention that Muradin have more Mana
  tension when his baseline quest for Storm Bolt was completed. Since Muradin
  already has a decent amount of Mana tension, we felt it was appropriate that
  this was lessened once he completes his quest.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Chen some small buffs that we believe
  are warranted to help out his ability to pressure enemies as well as beef up
  some underperforming talents. We don't expect these changes to drastically
  change how he plays, but they should help him perform better in the laning
  phase and give him some extra power to look forward to in later parts of the
  game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We want Safety in Numbers to be a more consistent
  talent to get value out of, so we're lowering the requirement for Deckard to
  be near only 2 friendly Heroes instead of 3, and slightly lowering its bonus
  to compensate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Tyrande a baseline Healing buff as well
  as making her W build more synergistically powerful. To compensate, we're
  slightly reducing Harsh Moonlight's power, though we still believe it will
  still be an incredibly strong talent, particularly when paired with Ranger at
  Level 1.</p>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beacon of Light [Q]</strong>

<li>Adjusted functionality: Uther receives 100% bonus self-healing when healing others with Holy Light. This bonus is increased to 200% while he is below 50% Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tyr's Deliverance [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase the damage and healing of Holy Radiance by 10%. Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes cause Uther's next cast of Holy Radiance to have its damage and healing increased by an additional 10%, stacking up to 4 times.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Uther's weakness to Poke and persistent AoE
  damage is intended, we feel he's a little too sharp in this direction, which
  too often disincentivizes players from running him as a Healer on his team.
  We're making him a bit better in this regard while also improving a couple of
  his Level 16 talents.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>

<li><strong>The Thirst [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Carnage heals for 50% of the damage dealt to enemy Heroes. Anytime Carnage damages an enemy Hero, Qhira's next Basic Attack within 4 seconds against an enemy Hero deals 15% additional damage, stacking up to 10 times.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown recharge rate increased from 200% to 250%.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some simple talent changes that should
  help Qhira's tiers be more competitive. Siphoning link in particular should be
  a lot more attractive now that it provides a bonus that is not reliant on
  hitting her Revolving Sweep, which is on a fairly long cooldown.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While more in-line after the past couple of balance
  changes, there were still a couple talents we wanted to address. Surge of
  Light is still slightly over-performing, while Power Strike needed something
  to give it a bit more punch. Lowering the damage of Surge of Light and giving
  a small cooldown reduction functionality to Power Strike should shift both
  talents into a better spot overall.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Once Again the First Time is currently dominating
  Chromie's Level 1 talents, which in turn greatly influences which talents
  Chromie players want to take on later tiers. The primary goal of these changes
  is to provide compelling, alternative ways to play her that can compete with
  what the talent currently offers.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has fallen out of the meta a bit, and these

  particular should help him clear waves more effectively in the early game as

  Level 13.</p>

  to have some more unique use cases and to generally improve diversity. We're
  also giving him some more reliable early-game wave clear by moving Incinerator
  Gauntlets to an earlier level and removing the effect of causing Basic Attacks
  to light Oil Spills and adding it to Adhesive Petroleum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some of Cho's talents more usable and
  experimenting with moving The Will of Cho to be a Level 1 questing talent. We
  like the talent, but it was coming online late into the game where he often
  couldn't get much value out of it. We believe this iteration will give it more
  use cases, particularly when matched against the other talents on the tier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Similar to E.T.C., we're increasing the cooldown of
  Iron Skin due to its ability to get Johanna out of a host of bad situations.

  Iron Skin's cooldown.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Muradin has been a staple Warrior at
  nearly all levels of play, acting as a powerful front line for his team.
  Recently he has fallen off a bit compared to his peers, but we don't believe
  he is too far off. We think he can benefit from a buff to Thunder Clap's
  ability to control the fight for his team, which should set up for easier
  Storm Bolt hits as well as allow him to better counter enemies who rely on
  Basic Attacks for effectiveness.</p>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time we have held to the belief that one
  important aspect of what makes Johanna special is her ability to provide more
  wave clear for her team compared to other Warriors. While this is true, it has
  gotten to the point that it has begun to limit what kinds of effective team
  compositions can be made, as any team that wants to run heroes that don't have
  a lot of wave clear really need Johanna to be competitive. To help open up
  more possible team compositions and to give Stitches a needed buff, we're
  experimenting with giving him comparable wave clear, which also has the side
  effect that he should be able to land more Hooks due to the enemy Minions
  dying faster. We're also removing our last Health buff that we gave him, as we
  believe leaning into this direction of giving him more wave clear and buffing
  his Hook range are more unique ways to bring Stitches to the forefront of
  Warriors that players want to bring to their team.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Safeguard's benefit has largely diminished over time

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we got Bloodlust in a good place in regards to
  its pick rate, it is too strong compared to Ancestral Healing, so we're
  nerfing its life leech and duration. We think this will give enemy teams a
  larger opportunity to play around its powerful buff, as it makes effects like
  Stuns, Blinds, and Attack Speed Slows more significant when it comes to
  surviving the burst of power that it gives to his team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tassadar is in a fairly good place, but Archon is a
  little too powerful compared to Black Hole, largely due to its ability to
  allow Tassadar to effectively get around one of his main weaknesses, which is
  being vulnerable to dive. We're reducing its power in this aspect, as well as
  making some small adjustments to his Level 7 talents in order to make Arc
  Discharge more competitive.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Many of Tychus's late-game talents aren't as exciting

  think will give players something better to look forward to as they progress

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur <span class="text-warning"><strong>every 4 minutes, with the first event
starting at the beginning of the match.</strong></span> Each weather event lasts for <span class="text-warning"><strong>2
minutes</strong></span> before clearing up. This cycle will repeat <span class="text-warning"><strong><s>periodically</s></strong></span>
until the game ends. While these weather events are active, Heroes can gain a
unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong><s>Periodically</s></strong></span> Strike all heroes with lightning <span class="text-warning"><strong>every 25-40 seconds</strong></span>, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by <span class="text-warning"><strong>15%</strong></span>.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for <span class="text-warning"><strong>46</strong></span> damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Heroes gain 28 Shields every 0.5 seconds, stacking up to 224 (8 stacks total).</strong></span></li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexomania II Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nexomania II is the summer event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of June 23 to week of September 7, PDT.</li>
<li>One of the most prestigious stops on the Nexomania circuit is the Intermultiversal Nexoweight Championship: No rules, no mercy, just nonstop, bicep-busting carnage. This time, many fans expected Mal'gaucho Mal'Ganis to win it all. The Swingin' Scourge of Stratholme tore a bloody path through his side of the bracket, burying opponents beneath a deluge of demonic blows. But on the other side of the bracket, a mysterious upstart known only as La Gata de Batalla has proven herself a worthy challenger, defeating foes many times her size en route to the championship match. The arena is packed, with Nexomania legend MC Tombstone roaring away on the mic, and the final battle is about to begin. Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Nexomania II event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Nexomania II Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Nexomania II Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' summer events limited-time loot chests!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become Nexomania II Loot Chests.</li>

<h3 id="storm-league">Storm League</h3>

<p>With the upcoming third Season of 2020, we wanted to make some changes to the
reward structure of Storm League.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Gold Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Season 3 of 2020, we are removing all Gold rewards from Storm League, End of Season prizes and Seasonal Questlines. This will also affect Season 2 rewards. The new Seasonal Questline reward structure is as follows: a Nexomania II Chest after 5 wins, a Rare Nexomania II Chest after 15 wins, and an Epic Nexomania II Chest after 30 wins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the inception of Storm League, we have received a lot of feedback about the retirement of Ranked Play reward Mounts. We have heard you and are extremely happy to announce the return of exclusive Storm League Mounts starting next season. The ultimate and final reward of the 2020 Season 3 Questline will be the Regal Tiger Mount, which will be awarded after winning 50 games in Ranked Play.</li>
<li>As of Season 3, you won't have to wait for the end of the Season to claim your well-earned Regal Tiger. It will become available as soon as you complete the four-step Storm League Quest Line. The mount only requires you to win 50 games and will be granted to players in all Leagues and Divisions.</li>
<li>As usual, we're happy to listen to your feedback. Please share your thoughts with us, so we can continue to adjust and evolve the Storm League rewards further.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our main goal with these changes is to make
  Mal'Ganis's talent tree as a whole more interesting and impactful. While we
  need to slightly nerf his base kit to keep him at a similar relative strength
  compared to other Warriors, we believe these changes will overall leave him in
  a powerful state while also giving players more expression in how they want to
  play Mal'Ganis in regards to his survivability and in how he controls the flow
  of battle.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur periodically. Each weather event lasts
for a few minutes at a time before clearing up. This cycle will repeat
periodically until the game ends. While these weather events are active,
Heroes can gain a unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodically strike all heroes with lightning, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by 25%.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for 64 damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li>Shield starts at 28 and slowly accumulates up to 224.</li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Garden of Terror</li>
<li>Sky Temple</li>
<li>Warhead Junction</li>
<li>Braxis Holdout</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexomania II Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nexomania II is the summer event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of June 23 to week of September 7, PDT.</li>
<li>One of the most prestigious stops on the Nexomania circuit is the Intermultiversal Nexoweight Championship: No rules, no mercy, just nonstop, bicep-busting carnage. This time, many fans expected Mal'gaucho Mal'Ganis to win it all. The Swingin' Scourge of Stratholme tore a bloody path through his side of the bracket, burying opponents beneath a deluge of demonic blows. But on the other side of the bracket, a mysterious upstart known only as La Gata de Batalla has proven herself a worthy challenger, defeating foes many times her size en route to the championship match. The arena is packed, with Nexomania legend MC Tombstone roaring away on the mic, and the final battle is about to begin. Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Nexomania II event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Nexomania II Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Nexomania II Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' summer events limited-time loot chests!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become Nexomania II Loot Chests.</li>

<h3 id="storm-league">Storm League</h3>

<p>With the upcoming third Season of 2020, we wanted to make some changes to the
reward structure of Storm League.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Gold Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Season 3 of 2020, we are removing all Gold rewards from Storm League, End of Season prizes and Seasonal Questlines. This will also affect Season 2 rewards. The new Seasonal Questline reward structure is as follows: a Nexomania II Chest after 5 wins, a Rare Nexomania II Chest after 15 wins, and an Epic Nexomania II Chest after 30 wins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the inception of Storm League, we have received a lot of feedback about the retirement of Ranked Play reward Mounts. We have heard you and are extremely happy to announce the return of exclusive Storm League Mounts starting next season. The ultimate and final reward of the 2020 Season 3 Questline will be the Regal Tiger Mount, which will be awarded after winning 50 games in Ranked Play.</li>
<li>As of Season 3, you won't have to wait for the end of the Season to claim your well-earned Regal Tiger. It will become available as soon as you complete the four-step Storm League Quest Line. The mount only requires you to win 50 games and will be granted to players in all Leagues and Divisions.</li>
<li>As usual, we're happy to listen to your feedback. Please share your thoughts with us, so we can continue to adjust and evolve the Storm League rewards further.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our main goal with these changes is to make
  Mal'Ganis's talent tree as a whole more interesting and impactful. While we
  need to slightly nerf his base kit to keep him at a similar relative strength
  compared to other Warriors, we believe these changes will overall leave him in
  a powerful state while also giving players more expression in how they want to
  play Mal'Ganis in regards to his survivability and in how he controls the flow
  of battle.</p>

<li>Health Scaling changed from 30 to 4% per level.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Murky's Spawn Egg to have the standard
  4% scaling that is present in most other places throughout the game. This is a
  buff to the egg's Health for most of the game, with its Health value being the
  same as its current level at around the Level 20 mark.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help - Balance Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep damage to enemy Heroes reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Maximum Armor reduction from Structures reduced from -40 to -20.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thank you for your discussions and feedback regarding
  the Call For Help system. We've seen a trend that players believe towers are
  still too punishing to dive under for lengthy periods of time, so we're going
  to reduce their damage as well as how powerful their Armor debuff is so that
  players are more incentivized to make aggressive plays when pushing. We'll be
  continuing to keep an eye on how these changes unfold, so please continue to
  give us your feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak is slightly underperforming compared to
  other Warriors. We believe his survivability could use a little boost, so
  we're increasing the Shield amount of Harden Carapace, which should make him
  even better at surviving burst damage, particularly from Abilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="stitches">Stitches</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chop Chop [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Slam grants 25% increased Attack Speed for 3 seconds. Double the Attack Speed bonus and duration if they are hit by the inner impact area of Slam.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The two defining unique attributes to Stitches are
  his ability to displace enemies from long range and his incredibly high Health
  pool that he is able to manipulate with Devour and various talent
  interactions. We're doubling down in his Health pool in this buff, which
  should let him stick around even longer in teamfights to harass enemies and
  protect his teammates.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tyrael's talents are in a decent spot, but there is
  generally one talent on each tier that players are gravitating towards a bit
  more than the others. These changes are targeted at one talent on each of
  those tiers to even them out more.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nordic Attack Squad [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Changed from a [W] to a passive talent.</li>
<li>New functionality: While Olaf, Baleog, and Erik are near each of the other Vikings, their Basic Attacks deal bonus damage equal to 1.25% maximum Health to enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since we last changed the Lost
  Vikings. This round of changes is targeted at making the Lost Vikings
  significantly more potent in PvP situations while keeping their map pressure
  in check. There are a few talents in particular that will give the Vikings
  powerful benefits when they fight together, which should reward players who
  are able to properly micro them during combat. We hope these changes open up
  new playstyles that never existed before, which should be exciting for those
  who take the time to master these Heroes.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small buffs to underperforming

  of improving her pick rates.</p>

<li>New functionality: After 1.5 seconds, Ancestral Healing is cast a second time on the same target. Allies near the target are healed for 590.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Farseer's Blessing to have a more
  universally powerful effect by having it proc a second time after its initial
  cast. This should give Ancestral Healing a lot more flexibility in its use
  cases since it can now save a single ally over a long period of time or

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We experimented a bit with Ranger and Darnassian
  Archery by making them fairly sharp in their use cases with incredibly high
  theoretical rewards. In Tyrande's case this hasn't panned out as we had hoped,
  so we're making them more generally useful, which we believe will be a net
  increase to their power.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Bulwark of Light's original planned change a few
  months ago was to give Divine Shield to all nearby Heroes. We thought that was
  too crazy, so we toned it down to only give 1 additional Hero the ability. The
  current iteration is not performing as well as we had hoped, so we're going
  back to our crazy idea. Hopefully this doesn't break the game.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Whitemane is performing very well in regards to her

  exist before, which should help her tree be more healthy overall. We believe
  the changes to Scarlet Wrath and Radiance in particular will enable some new
  and interesting ways to play Whitemane by rewarding her for properly managing
  her Desperation Stacks in conjunction with when she chooses to cast Zeal.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Genji has posted a low overall win rate for some

  players, the skill requirement to be effective on him is a little too high for
  the vast majority of players. We're slightly buffing his health and reducing
  his overall mobility with Cyber Agility, in addition to buffing a few of his
  underperforming talents. This should move him into a better place,
  particularly in regards to his survivability in more general situations.</p>
