<ul>
<li>Deal 21 damage every second to nearby enemies. Beetles deal 7 damage to nearby enemies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We saw some feedback that Anub'arak's Burning Rage
  could be better themed for the hero, and we agreed. We present to you, Burning
  Beetles!</p>

<h4 id="arthas">Arthas</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Howling Blast [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Range increased from 8 to 9.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frost Presence [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus range to Howling Blast reduced from 30% to 20%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death's Advance [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is now an E talent.</li>
<li>New functionality: Increase Movement Speed by 10%. Frozen Tempest's maximum Slow and Attack Speed Slow increased from 40% to 60%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Howling Blast has been the same for a very long time,
  almost since the inception of our game. Many things have changed since then,
  and we believe a range increase is warranted due to how average ranges of
  various abilities and effects have changed since that time.</p>

<h4 id="blaze">Blaze</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Shield amount increased from 480 to 530.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bonus damage to Minons, Mercenaries, and Monsters reduced from 70% to 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we achieved our previous goal of making
  Incinerator Gauntlets a powerful PvE option, we overshot a bit and are
  reducing its power to be more in line with what other Warriors can bring to
  the table in this area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="etc">E.T.C.</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guitar Hero [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration bonus increased from .25 to .5 seconds.</li>
<li>Healing reduced from 60% to 50% damage dealt.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crowd Surfer [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: If Powerslide hits no enemies, then reduce its cooldown by 5 seconds and refund its Mana cost.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hammer-On [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: While Guitar Solo is active, Basic Attacks deal 30% bonus damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encore [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemy Heroes knocked back by Face Melt or the Amp reduce E.T.C.'s Heroic cooldown by 8%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crowd Pleaser [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces the cooldown of Stage Dive.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Slow amount of Stage Dive by 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We were a little hesitant to make talent changes to
  E.T.C. due to how well he has been performing, even though we felt he could
  use some help in that department. We don't believe that holding off
  indefinitely on needed talent improvements just because a Hero is performing
  well serves our Heroes in the best way over the long term, so we're making
  these improvements and will adjust accordingly once we see how they settle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="mei">Mei</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crystallize [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor amount reduced from 50 to 40.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cold Front [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 7 to 8 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana return increased from 50 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avalanche [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 70 to 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost increased from 70 to 80.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>â€‹<strong>Flurry [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown refresh rate increased from 75% to 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are super happy with where Mei is sitting overall,
  but wanted to continue tuning some talents to help even things out. While
  doing so, we also increased the cooldown of Avalanche substantially, as it
  feels like she has too much up-time on its availability in team fights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="muradin">Muradin</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Storm Bolt [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Quest completion also causes Muradin's Basic Attacks to grant him 3 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It was not our intention that Muradin have more Mana
  tension when his baseline quest for Storm Bolt was completed. Since Muradin
  already has a decent amount of Mana tension, we felt it was appropriate that
  this was lessened once he completes his quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bruiser">Bruiser</h3>

<h4 id="chen">Chen</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breath of Fire [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>DoT damage increased from 55 to 57.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freshest Ingredients [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regeneration Globe duration increased from 100% to 150%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Celerity [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Chen some small buffs that we believe
  are warranted to help out his ability to pressure enemies as well as beef up
  some underperforming talents. We don't expect these changes to drastically
  change how he plays, but they should help him perform better in the laning
  phase and give him some extra power to look forward to in later parts of the
  game.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="deathwing">Deathwing</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Molten Blood [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from .5% to .6% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> This talent change is meant to compensate for our
  earlier changes to Deathwing where we lowered his Health.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="healer">Healer</h3>

<h4 id="deckard">Deckard</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety in Numbers [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Required number of allied Heroes nearby to gain bonuses reduced from 3 to 2.</li>
<li>Armor bonus reduced from 15 to 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We want Safety in Numbers to be a more consistent
  talent to get value out of, so we're lowering the requirement for Deckard to
  be near only 2 friendly Heroes instead of 3, and slightly lowering its bonus
  to compensate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tyrande">Tyrande</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Light of Elune [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from 255 to 270.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harsh Moonlight [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now applies its Slow and damage reduction to all targets hit, as well as visually shrinking them.</li>
<li>Damage reduction reduced from 40% to 35%.</li>
<li>Slow amount reduced from 40% to 35%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ranger's Mark [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction of Lunar Flare increased from 1.5 to 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empower [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now deals bonus damage to all targets hit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Tyrande a baseline Healing buff as well
  as making her W build more synergistically powerful. To compensate, we're
  slightly reducing Harsh Moonlight's power, though we still believe it will
  still be an incredibly strong talent, particularly when paired with Ranger at
  Level 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="uther">Uther</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2000 to 1975.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.17 to 4.11.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Radiance [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 12 to 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost reduced from 70 to 55.</li>
<li>Healing amount increased from 177 to 194.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wave of Light [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 1 to .75 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beacon of Light [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Uther receives 100% bonus self-healing when healing others with Holy Light. This bonus is increased to 200% while he is below 50% Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tyr's Deliverance [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase the damage and healing of Holy Radiance by 10%. Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes cause Uther's next cast of Holy Radiance to have its damage and healing increased by an additional 10%, stacking up to 4 times.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Uther's weakness to Poke and persistent AoE
  damage is intended, we feel he's a little too sharp in this direction, which
  too often disincentivizes players from running him as a Healer on his team.
  We're making him a bit better in this regard while also improving a couple of
  his Level 16 talents.</p>

<h4 id="illidan">Illidan</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid Chase [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Dive by 1 second when it deals damage to an enemy Hero.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunter's Onslaught [Trait]</strong>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiery Brand [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attacks required to deal bonus damage reduced from 4 to 3.</li>
<li>Damage reduced from 9% to 7% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some simple changes to underperforming
  talents that should make them more competitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="qhira">Qhira</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Thirst [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Carnage heals for 50% of the damage dealt to enemy Heroes. Anytime Carnage damages an enemy Hero, Qhira's next Basic Attack within 4 seconds against an enemy Hero deals 15% additional damage, stacking up to 10 times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Siphoning Link [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Qhira heals for 20% of her damage dealt by Basic Attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lingering Ailment [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemy Heroes hit by Grappling Hook have their Armor reduced by 15 for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Swing Life Away [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown recharge rate increased from 200% to 250%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some simple talent changes that should
  help Qhira's tiers be more competitive. Siphoning link in particular should be
  a lot more attractive now that it provides a bonus that is not reliant on
  hitting her Revolving Sweep, which is on a fairly long cooldown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="zeratul">Zeratul</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unwavering Pressure [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Remove the Mana cost of Singularity Spike. Basic Attacks against non-Heroic targets reduce the cooldown of Singularity Spike by 1.25 second, and by 2.5 seconds against enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shadow Stride [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Casting Vorpal Blade grants Zeratul a Shield that absorbs 260 damage over 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We missed the mark on our initial changes to
  Zeratul's Level 20 talents. We're beefing them up to be more competitive.</p>

<h3 id="ranged-assassin">Ranged Assassin</h3>

<h4 id="cassia">Cassia</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surge of Light [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 285 to 250.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Strike [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality:Heroes hit by Lightning Fury reduce its cooldown by 1 second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While more in-line after the past couple of balance
  changes, there were still a couple talents we wanted to address. Surge of
  Light is still slightly over-performing, while Power Strike needed something
  to give it a bit more punch. Lowering the damage of Surge of Light and giving
  a small cooldown reduction functionality to Power Strike should shift both
  talents into a better spot overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="chromie">Chromie</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Breathing [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Quest: Every time Dragon's Breath hits an enemy Hero, increase its damage by 1.5%, up to 30%. Reward: After hitting 20 Heroes, reduce the cooldown of Dragon's Breath by 5 seconds and its Mana cost from 65 to 30.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Timewalker's Pursuit [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Gain 15% Spell Power and reduce the arming time of Time Traps by .75 seconds. Activate to reveal the targeted area for 2 seconds. Enemies seen are revealed for 4 seconds. 25-second cooldown.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 5</strong>
<ul>
<li>â€‹<strong>Mobius Loop [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Dragon's Breath deals 50% bonus damage to enemies hit by its center. Enemy Heroes hit by its center are Slowed by 60% for 1 second.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 8</strong>

<li><strong>Slowing Sands [R1]</strong>

<li><strong>Unravelling [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spell Armor reduction increased from 5 to 7.</li>
<li>Spell Armor maximum stacks reduced from 6 to 5.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Slowing Sands persists for 5 seconds after it is cancelled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Once Again the First Time is currently dominating
  Chromie's Level 1 talents, which in turn greatly influences which talents
  Chromie players want to take on later tiers. The primary goal of these changes
  is to provide compelling, alternative ways to play her that can compete with
  what the talent currently offers.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has fallen out of the meta a bit, and these
  changes are intended to help him be more competitive. His Basic Attack buff in
  particular should help him clear waves more effectively in the early game as
  well as serve as an extra incentive for players to try taking Bombs Away at
  Level 13.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing up many of Blaze's early game talents
  to have some more unique use cases and to generally improve diversity. We're
  also giving him some more reliable early-game wave clear by moving Incinerator
  Gauntlets to an earlier level and removing the effect of causing Basic Attacks
  to light Oil Spills and adding it to Adhesive Petroleum.</p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Will of Cho [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 20.</li>
<li>New functionality: Killing enemy Minions grants 1 stack of The Will of Cho, and Hero Takedowns grant 10 stacks. Gain 1 Armor for every 30 stacks of the Will of Cho, up to a maximum of 10 Armor. This Armor bonus stacks with Ogre Hide.</li>

<li><strong>Uppercut [Q]</strong>
<ul>

<li>Additional functionality: Each Hero hit by Surging Fist reduces its cooldown by 5 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>

<li><strong>Fuel for the Flame [Passive]</strong>

<li>New functionality: Basic Attacks against enemies cause them to explode, dealing 21 damage to them and 45 damage to nearby enemies. This damage is doubled against enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some of Cho's talents more usable and
  experimenting with moving The Will of Cho to be a Level 1 questing talent. We
  like the talent, but it was coming online late into the game where he often
  couldn't get much value out of it. We believe this iteration will give it more
  use cases, particularly when matched against the other talents on the tier.</p>

<li>Cooldown increased from 10 to 12 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost increased from 50 to 55.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Due to its high number of use cases and ability to
  almost universally get E.T.C. out of sticky situations, we're increasing the
  cooldown of Face Melt to give players a larger window of time to take
  advantage of after E.T.C. uses the ability.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've had some feedback that many of Garrosh's late-
  game talents aren't impactful enough and we agreed, so we're making some
  improvements in this area.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Iron Skin [Trait]</strong>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Similar to E.T.C., we're increasing the cooldown of
  Iron Skin due to its ability to get Johanna out of a host of bad situations.
  This should give enemy teams a bigger window of time to plan and play around
  Iron Skin's cooldown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mei's introduction to the Nexus has been very cool.
  Her crisp performance has solidified her as a powerful member of any team. She
  is doing well but is not showing signs of being too strong just yet, so we are
  primarily adjusting her talents to be in a more solid place.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thunder Clap [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Movement and Attack Speed Slows increased from 25% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time Muradin has been a staple Warrior at
  nearly all levels of play, acting as a powerful front line for his team.
  Recently he has fallen off a bit compared to his peers, but we don't believe
  he is too far off. We think he can benefit from a buff to Thunder Clap's
  ability to control the fight for his team, which should set up for easier
  Storm Bolt hits as well as allow him to better counter enemies who rely on
  Basic Attacks for effectiveness.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fishing Hook [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus range reduced from 50% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time we have held to the belief that one
  important aspect of what makes Johanna special is her ability to provide more
  wave clear for her team compared to other Warriors. While this is true, it has
  gotten to the point that it has begun to limit what kinds of effective team
  compositions can be made, as any team that wants to run heroes that don't have
  a lot of wave clear really need Johanna to be competitive. To help open up
  more possible team compositions and to give Stitches a needed buff, we're
  experimenting with giving him comparable wave clear, which also has the side
  effect that he should be able to land more Hooks due to the enemy Minions
  dying faster. We're also removing our last Health buff that we gave him, as we
  believe leaning into this direction of giving him more wave clear and buffing
  his Hook range are more unique ways to bring Stitches to the forefront of
  Warriors that players want to bring to their team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Yrel's level 1 talent pick has over time become

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Kharazim's healing output is a little lower than

  Kharazim players and teams who are good about grouping around him to receive

<li>Armor amount increased from 30 to 35.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Safeguard's benefit has largely diminished over time
  due to a combination of various Heroes being able to gain Armor in the 20-25
  range and our change to make Armor not stack anymore. To make it stand out
  more and to give Lt. Morales a needed buff, we're increasing its Armor amount
  so that it can be used more often to benefit members of her team.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we got Bloodlust in a good place in regards to
  its pick rate, it is too strong compared to Ancestral Healing, so we're
  nerfing its life leech and duration. We think this will give enemy teams a
  larger opportunity to play around its powerful buff, as it makes effects like
  Stuns, Blinds, and Attack Speed Slows more significant when it comes to
  surviving the burst of power that it gives to his team.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're toning down Cursed Bullet's damage due to it

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tassadar is in a fairly good place, but Archon is a
  little too powerful compared to Black Hole, largely due to its ability to
  allow Tassadar to effectively get around one of his main weaknesses, which is
  being vulnerable to dive. We're reducing its power in this aspect, as well as
  making some small adjustments to his Level 7 talents in order to make Arc
  Discharge more competitive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Many of Tychus's late-game talents aren't as exciting
  as we would like, and we believe we can do better in regards to giving him a
  meaningful power spike. We're giving him loads of compelling options, which we
  think will give players something better to look forward to as they progress

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly">Nexus Anomaly</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur <span class="text-warning"><strong>every 4 minutes, with the first event
starting at the beginning of the match.</strong></span> Each weather event lasts for <span class="text-warning"><strong>2
minutes</strong></span> before clearing up. This cycle will repeat <span class="text-warning"><strong><s>periodically</s></strong></span>
until the game ends. While these weather events are active, Heroes can gain a
unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong><s>Periodically</s></strong></span> Strike all heroes with lightning <span class="text-warning"><strong>every 25-40 seconds</strong></span>, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by <span class="text-warning"><strong>15%</strong></span>.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for <span class="text-warning"><strong>46</strong></span> damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Heroes gain 28 Shields every 0.5 seconds, stacking up to 224 (8 stacks total).</strong></span></li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Garden of Terror</li>
<li>Sky Temple</li>
<li>Warhead Junction</li>
<li>Braxis Holdout</li>

<h3 id="event">Event</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexomania II Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nexomania II is the summer event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of June 23 to week of September 7, PDT.</li>
<li>One of the most prestigious stops on the Nexomania circuit is the Intermultiversal Nexoweight Championship: No rules, no mercy, just nonstop, bicep-busting carnage. This time, many fans expected Mal'gaucho Mal'Ganis to win it all. The Swingin' Scourge of Stratholme tore a bloody path through his side of the bracket, burying opponents beneath a deluge of demonic blows. But on the other side of the bracket, a mysterious upstart known only as La Gata de Batalla has proven herself a worthy challenger, defeating foes many times her size en route to the championship match. The arena is packed, with Nexomania legend MC Tombstone roaring away on the mic, and the final battle is about to begin. Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Nexomania II event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Nexomania II Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Nexomania II Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' summer events limited-time loot chests!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become Nexomania II Loot Chests.</li>

<p>With the upcoming third Season of 2020, we wanted to make some changes to the
reward structure of Storm League.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Gold Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Season 3 of 2020, we are removing all Gold rewards from Storm League, End of Season prizes and Seasonal Questlines. This will also affect Season 2 rewards. The new Seasonal Questline reward structure is as follows: a Nexomania II Chest after 5 wins, a Rare Nexomania II Chest after 15 wins, and an Epic Nexomania II Chest after 30 wins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the inception of Storm League, we have received a lot of feedback about the retirement of Ranked Play reward Mounts. We have heard you and are extremely happy to announce the return of exclusive Storm League Mounts starting next season. The ultimate and final reward of the 2020 Season 3 Questline will be the Regal Tiger Mount, which will be awarded after winning 50 games in Ranked Play.</li>
<li>As of Season 3, you won't have to wait for the end of the Season to claim your well-earned Regal Tiger. It will become available as soon as you complete the four-step Storm League Quest Line. The mount only requires you to win 50 games and will be granted to players in all Leagues and Divisions.</li>
<li>As usual, we're happy to listen to your feedback. Please share your thoughts with us, so we can continue to adjust and evolve the Storm League rewards further.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our main goal with these changes is to make
  Mal'Ganis's talent tree as a whole more interesting and impactful. While we
  need to slightly nerf his base kit to keep him at a similar relative strength
  compared to other Warriors, we believe these changes will overall leave him in
  a powerful state while also giving players more expression in how they want to
  play Mal'Ganis in regards to his survivability and in how he controls the flow
  of battle.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur periodically. Each weather event lasts
for a few minutes at a time before clearing up. This cycle will repeat
periodically until the game ends. While these weather events are active,
Heroes can gain a unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodically strike all heroes with lightning, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by 25%.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for 64 damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li>Shield starts at 28 and slowly accumulates up to 224.</li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Garden of Terror</li>
<li>Sky Temple</li>
<li>Warhead Junction</li>
<li>Braxis Holdout</li>

<h3 id="event">Event</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexomania II Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nexomania II is the summer event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of June 23 to week of September 7, PDT.</li>
<li>One of the most prestigious stops on the Nexomania circuit is the Intermultiversal Nexoweight Championship: No rules, no mercy, just nonstop, bicep-busting carnage. This time, many fans expected Mal'gaucho Mal'Ganis to win it all. The Swingin' Scourge of Stratholme tore a bloody path through his side of the bracket, burying opponents beneath a deluge of demonic blows. But on the other side of the bracket, a mysterious upstart known only as La Gata de Batalla has proven herself a worthy challenger, defeating foes many times her size en route to the championship match. The arena is packed, with Nexomania legend MC Tombstone roaring away on the mic, and the final battle is about to begin. Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Nexomania II event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Nexomania II Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Nexomania II Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' summer events limited-time loot chests!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become Nexomania II Loot Chests.</li>

<h3 id="storm-league">Storm League</h3>

<p>With the upcoming third Season of 2020, we wanted to make some changes to the
reward structure of Storm League.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Gold Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Season 3 of 2020, we are removing all Gold rewards from Storm League, End of Season prizes and Seasonal Questlines. This will also affect Season 2 rewards. The new Seasonal Questline reward structure is as follows: a Nexomania II Chest after 5 wins, a Rare Nexomania II Chest after 15 wins, and an Epic Nexomania II Chest after 30 wins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the inception of Storm League, we have received a lot of feedback about the retirement of Ranked Play reward Mounts. We have heard you and are extremely happy to announce the return of exclusive Storm League Mounts starting next season. The ultimate and final reward of the 2020 Season 3 Questline will be the Regal Tiger Mount, which will be awarded after winning 50 games in Ranked Play.</li>
<li>As of Season 3, you won't have to wait for the end of the Season to claim your well-earned Regal Tiger. It will become available as soon as you complete the four-step Storm League Quest Line. The mount only requires you to win 50 games and will be granted to players in all Leagues and Divisions.</li>
<li>As usual, we're happy to listen to your feedback. Please share your thoughts with us, so we can continue to adjust and evolve the Storm League rewards further.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Night Beckons [E]</strong>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our main goal with these changes is to make
  Mal'Ganis's talent tree as a whole more interesting and impactful. While we
  need to slightly nerf his base kit to keep him at a similar relative strength
  compared to other Warriors, we believe these changes will overall leave him in
  a powerful state while also giving players more expression in how they want to
  play Mal'Ganis in regards to his survivability and in how he controls the flow
  of battle.</p>

<li>Health increased from 324 to 420.</li>
<li>Health Scaling changed from 30 to 4% per level.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Murky's Spawn Egg to have the standard
  4% scaling that is present in most other places throughout the game. This is a
  buff to the egg's Health for most of the game, with its Health value being the
  same as its current level at around the Level 20 mark.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help - Balance Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep damage to enemy Heroes reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Maximum Armor reduction from Structures reduced from -40 to -20.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thank you for your discussions and feedback regarding
  the Call For Help system. We've seen a trend that players believe towers are
  still too punishing to dive under for lengthy periods of time, so we're going
  to reduce their damage as well as how powerful their Armor debuff is so that
  players are more incentivized to make aggressive plays when pushing. We'll be
  continuing to keep an eye on how these changes unfold, so please continue to
  give us your feedback.</p>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<li>Bonus attack damage increased from 20% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak is slightly underperforming compared to
  other Warriors. We believe his survivability could use a little boost, so
  we're increasing the Shield amount of Harden Carapace, which should make him
  even better at surviving burst damage, particularly from Abilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="stitches">Stitches</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 3060 to 3150.</li>
<li>Health regeneration increased from 6.38 to 6.56.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chop Chop [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Slam grants 25% increased Attack Speed for 3 seconds. Double the Attack Speed bonus and duration if they are hit by the inner impact area of Slam.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The two defining unique attributes to Stitches are
  his ability to displace enemies from long range and his incredibly high Health
  pool that he is able to manipulate with Devour and various talent
  interactions. We're doubling down in his Health pool in this buff, which
  should let him stick around even longer in teamfights to harass enemies and
  protect his teammates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tyrael's talents are in a decent spot, but there is
  generally one talent on each tier that players are gravitating towards a bit
  more than the others. These changes are targeted at one talent on each of
  those tiers to even them out more.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Increase Olaf's Health by 20%.</li>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baleog the Fierce [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase Baleog's attack range by 2.5. While near Olaf and Erik, he becomes inspired by the power of teamwork and his Attack Speed is increased by 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spin to Win! [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 101 to 85.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Deals double damage against enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Norse Force! [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 15 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longboat Raid [R1]</strong>

<li>Health increased from 685 to 750.</li>
<li>Health bonus per Viking increased from 171 to 185.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Play Again! [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 80 to 100 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nordic Attack Squad [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Changed from a [W] to a passive talent.</li>
<li>New functionality: While Olaf, Baleog, and Erik are near each of the other Vikings, their Basic Attacks deal bonus damage equal to 1.25% maximum Health to enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since we last changed the Lost
  Vikings. This round of changes is targeted at making the Lost Vikings
  significantly more potent in PvP situations while keeping their map pressure
  in check. There are a few talents in particular that will give the Vikings
  powerful benefits when they fight together, which should reward players who
  are able to properly micro them during combat. We hope these changes open up
  new playstyles that never existed before, which should be exciting for those
  who take the time to master these Heroes.</p>

<li>Energy requirement for bonus healing reduced from 70 to 60.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small buffs to underperforming
  talents throughout Lt. Morales's tree. She is performing appropriately
  overall, so we don't expect these buffs to be a massive change for her outside
  of improving her pick rates.</p>

<li>New functionality: After 1.5 seconds, Ancestral Healing is cast a second time on the same target. Allies near the target are healed for 590.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Farseer's Blessing to have a more
  universally powerful effect by having it proc a second time after its initial
  cast. This should give Ancestral Healing a lot more flexibility in its use
  cases since it can now save a single ally over a long period of time or
  potentially even heal Rehgar's team for a massive amount if they stay grouped
  together.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Huntress' Fury [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Basic Attacks only splash to nearby enemy Heroes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Duration reduced from 6 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>No longer loses its bonus when attacking non-Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We experimented a bit with Ranger and Darnassian
  Archery by making them fairly sharp in their use cases with incredibly high
  theoretical rewards. In Tyrande's case this hasn't panned out as we had hoped,
  so we're making them more generally useful, which we believe will be a net
  increase to their power.</p>

<li><strong>Divine Protection [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor amount increased from 40 to 50.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Bulwark of Light's original planned change a few
  months ago was to give Divine Shield to all nearby Heroes. We thought that was
  too crazy, so we toned it down to only give 1 additional Hero the ability. The
  current iteration is not performing as well as we had hoped, so we're going
  back to our crazy idea. Hopefully this doesn't break the game.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Righteous Flame [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase the damage of Searing Lash by 25%. If the second strike of Searing Lash hits an enemy Hero, the bonus damage is increased to 50% and grants Whitemane 25% increased Attack Speed for 4 seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiance [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: If Zeal is cast while Whitemane has 3 stacks of Desperation, then instead of reducing Whitemane's Armor it instead increases her Armor by 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Whitemane is performing very well in regards to her
  overall power, but we think her talents could use some work in their
  competitiveness. These changes should open up some new synergies that did not
  exist before, which should help her tree be more healthy overall. We believe
  the changes to Scarlet Wrath and Radiance in particular will enable some new
  and interesting ways to play Whitemane by rewarding her for properly managing
  her Desperation Stacks in conjunction with when she chooses to cast Zeal.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since we've made any large changes
  to Qhira. She is a little underperforming, so we're buffing her Health and
  making some changes to various talents to improve their competitiveness and
  Qhira's overall power. Fatal Wounds is currently representing too much of her
  power pie, so we're reducing that talent's power while improving various other
  parts of her tree to compensate.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Genji has posted a low overall win rate for some

  players, the skill requirement to be effective on him is a little too high for
  the vast majority of players. We're slightly buffing his health and reducing
  his overall mobility with Cyber Agility, in addition to buffing a few of his
  underperforming talents. This should move him into a better place,
  particularly in regards to his survivability in more general situations.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep structure damage reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Structures will only focus their attacks on enemy Heroes if they attack an allied Hero who is also in their range.</li>
<li>Self-damage from Heroes will no longer cause structures to focus them.</li>
<li>Periodic damage over time will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to the Call for Help system
  that should help the overall player experience. We believe that currently
  Towers are punishing aggressive play too much, so we're lowering their damage
  to give diving Heroes more time to make plays before they have to escape. Our
  goal overall with the system is to still have aggressive play be possible and
  rewarded, but to also give the defending team a way to punish prolonged Tower
  dives, which is primarily due to the stacking Armor debuff. We're also
  changing the A.I. of structures to require that both the attacking and
  defending Hero be in their range in order for them to switch aggro onto an
  aggressor. This means that the defending Hero needs to also be near their
  structures in order to be defended, and it removes some unintuitive situations
  where a Hero can get aggro from attacks that are happening in far away places.
  Lastly, periodic damage will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes, so
  Heroes like Lunara will no longer pull aggro for the entirety of their DoT
  effects.</p>

<li>Laner version Health scaling reduced by ~10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players believe the pushing
  Samurai camp is too strong and the objective is too weak. For some insight, we
  purposefully designed the map so that the Samurai camp was uniquely powerful,
  and we wanted it to be a viable, effective strategy that was available for a
  large portion of the game, particularly since the map only has 2 lanes. Now
  that the map has been out for some time, we believe that the balance of power
  can shift a little in favor of the objective being a more central way to win
  the game.</p>

  While he's in a much better place now, he can use some more toning down. We're

  of its effects and giving it to Firestorm. For players who want to build
  around going up and landing more often, Firestorm will now be the premier
  talent for that playstyle, whereas players who want to do damage while in the
  air, interrupt objectives, or heal themselves more can continue to take
  Skyfall.</p>

  and the game has changed significantly since that time. We're giving him a
  small buff to Dark Swarm and combining Constriction and Paralyzing Enzymes to
  create a more powerful, single talent. We're also adding a strong defensive
  option at Level 16 that plays into his desire to fight near bushes.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sustaining Power has been a difficult sell as a

  more inclined to go for Extended Lightning, since it adds more benefits that

  that it outshines Extended Lightning, we're changing it to do its own unique
  effect. Overwhelming Power should synergize well with talents like Hindered
  Motion and Mocking Strikes, allowing Alarak players who are able to stick to
  their targets to do a lot of sustained damage while keeping themselves alive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since her release, Cassia has been a great counter-
  pick against teams bringing multiple Basic Attackers. When she was being
  created, the Hero Designer was working closely with the Live Design team to
  find a good niche for her to fill. Since that time, however, our design
  philosophies have changed, and you have been seeing us pull-back from any
  individual Hero being too sharp in their designs. The War Matron is no
  exception and her rework tries to keep her original playstyle intact while
  also opening up options for players to bring her into more team compositions.
  Our other goals with the rework were to enhance her Lightning Javazon fantasy
  and introduce new talent-interactions for aficionados to really sink their
  teeth into. It would seem that with Cassia lightning does in fact strike twice
  and we are excited to see what you can do with her!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We always have to be careful about introducing too
  much power into Hero designs that are both mobile and bursty, because even if
  they are balanced on paper, they can feel extremely oppressive to play
  against. When this does happen, our normal reaction is to slowly tune those
  Heroes down until they don't feel awful to play against. Unfortunately, this
  can cause a variety of issues; in Tracer's case, she became extremely reliant
  on a handful of other Heroes to really open up her kit and make it work. With
  her rework, we focused on trying to make her feel a bit more self-reliant
  while also giving opponents a bit more time to react to her Recall and lock
  her down. On top of this, we have rebuilt her talent tree in order to give our
  Pulse-Pistol wielding Heroine some fun new options while she time-jumps around
  the Nexus.</p>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch is live and brings a new Dark Nexus II
event, new skins and mounts, along with a Tassadar rework and more! Read on
for more information.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blackheart's Bay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot a cannonball at 2 nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage, slowing them by 70% for 1.5 seconds, and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot 5 missiles at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage per missile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cursed Hollow</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 3 seconds, the Core will spawn a Curse under a nearby enemy Hero. If they are Cursed, they take 5% maximum Health as damage and their Armor is reduced by 75 for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dragonshire</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core will throw 2 boulders at a nearby enemy Hero. Heroes hit are turned to stone, damaged for 5% of their maximum Health, and Stunned for 1.75 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Garden of Terror</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core shoots a seed under a nearby enemy Hero. When the seed explodes, Heroes inside are Polymorphed for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core fires 2 volleys of missiles around it, dealing 5% maximum Health to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sky Temple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 23 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 sets of 6 tornadoes which swirl around it, dealing 25 damage to enemy Heroes and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core will shoot a Death Wave, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volskaya</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core shoots 3 Rocket Fists at nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 150 damage and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warhead Junction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 18 seconds, the Core launches a Nuke at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 30% maximum health to enemy Heroes hit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Mastery Rings - Tier 3</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Get ready to show off your dedication to your favorite Heroes with the next level of Hero Mastery Rings! These new rings become purchasable once a Hero reaches level 50 and you already own the first and second rings for that Hero.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A.I.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. trees have been refactored in order to reduce conflicts between the tactical and goal systems.</li>
<li>Agents will attempt to stage and wait for backup around objectives before attempting to contest.</li>
<li>Disconnected players will have their A.I. return to base and remain there unless they are pinged to follow. 
<ul>
<li>Follow behavior is the same for disconnected player A.I. and normal A.I.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will attempt to fight while remaining close to their follow target, leashing back if they wander too far away.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will mount or use their Hearthstone if their follow target uses their mount or Hearthstone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting A.I. Healing Well goal health threshold from 75% to 60%.</li>
<li>Bringing an A.I. who is on follow close enough to Doubloon turn-in on Blackheart's Bay, Soul Gem turn-in on Tomb of the Spider Queen, or a healing fountain will cause the A.I. to interact with them appropriately if they are able.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Favorite Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create your favorite talent builds</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can pick their favorite talents on the talent panel from Hero select or draft screen.</li>

<li>Players can create up to 3 builds per each Hero and can activate one build at a time.</li>
<li>To switch to a different build, click the build buttons shown on the top of the talent panel.</li>
<li>If any significant change happens to a talent tier due to a balance patch, the selection for the tier will be reset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Share your favorite builds</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can generate a hyperlink for a talent build by clicking the cog menu next to talent build buttons on the Hero select screen.</li>
<li>If you paste this link on the chat, it shows as a hyperlink in the chat history.</li>
<li>If you left click the link, it shows the preview of the talent build.</li>
<li>By right clicking the link, you can copy the link to your clipboard or directly save it to your Hero's corresponding build slots.</li>
<li>The format of the talent hyperlink is as follows. [T1231231,Lucio]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>In-Game &amp; End of the match screen</strong>
<ul>
<li>A favorited talent will display a favorite icon on top of it.</li>
<li>You can switch the build in the middle of the game based on your strategy.</li>
<li>For the future tiers, you can adjust your favorites by clicking the talent button in the same way you would do in the Hero select screen.</li>
<li>All changes made in game are saved.</li>
<li>After game ends, you can use the cog menu on the talent tab to copy other players' talent builds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blackheart's Bay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot a cannonball at 2 nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage, slowing them by 70% for 1.5 seconds, and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot 5 missiles at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage per missile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cursed Hollow</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 3 seconds, the Core will spawn a Curse under a nearby enemy Hero. If they are Cursed, they take 5% maximum Health as damage and their Armor is reduced by 75 for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dragonshire</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core will throw 2 boulders at a nearby enemy Hero. Heroes hit are turned to stone, damaged for 5% of their maximum Health, and Stunned for 1.75 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Garden of Terror</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core shoots a seed under a nearby enemy Hero. When the seed explodes, Heroes inside are Polymorphed for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core fires 2 volleys of missiles around it, dealing 5% maximum Health to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sky Temple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 23 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 sets of 6 tornadoes which swirl around it, dealing 25 damage to enemy Heroes and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core will shoot a Death Wave, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volskaya</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core shoots 3 Rocket Fists at nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 150 damage and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warhead Junction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 18 seconds, the Core launches a Nuke at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 30% maximum health to enemy Heroes hit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Mastery Rings - Tier 3</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Get ready to show off your dedication to your favorite Heroes with the next level of Hero Mastery Rings! These new rings become purchasable once a Hero reaches level 50 and you already own the first and second rings for that Hero.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A.I.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. trees have been refactored in order to reduce conflicts between the tactical and goal systems.</li>
<li>Agents will attempt to stage and wait for backup around objectives before attempting to contest.</li>
<li>Disconnected players will have their A.I. return to base and remain there unless they are pinged to follow. 
<ul>
<li>Follow behavior is the same for disconnected player A.I. and normal A.I.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will attempt to fight while remaining close to their follow target, leashing back if they wander too far away.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will mount or use their Hearthstone if their follow target uses their mount or Hearthstone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting A.I. Healing Well goal health threshold from 75% to 60%.</li>
<li>Bringing an A.I. who is on follow close enough to Doubloon turn-in on Blackheart's Bay, Soul Gem turn-in on Tomb of the Spider Queen, or a healing fountain will cause the A.I. to interact with them appropriately if they are able.</li>
</ul>

<li>Players can create up to 3 builds per each Hero and can activate one build at a time.</li>
<li>To switch to a different build, click the build buttons shown on the top of the talent panel.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Share your favorite builds</strong>

<li>After game ends, you can use the cog menu on the talent tab to copy other players' talent builds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

<h4 id="xul">Xul</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2200 to 2080.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.58 to 4.33.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Arthas is slightly underperforming compared to other
  Warriors, so we're giving him a small baseline Health buff which we feel is
  appropriate since he doesn't have the mobility that a lot of other Warriors
  bring to the table. We've also taken a look at his Level 20 talents and beefed
  them up all be much more epic.</p>

  how players miss the unique role he had as a tank who had the ability to burst
  down enemies who are out of position. We're giving a little bit of that back
  in the form of a baseline buff to Shadow charge so that he can have some of
  that fantasy back no matter how players choose to build him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rexxar's ability to win the laning phase on point
  control maps is a little too powerful, so we're nerfing his ability to keep
  Misha alive. To compensate him for this nerf, we're increasing his Basic
  Attack damage, which will both help him in latter parts of the game and make
  the early game more about how well he can work with Misha to outtrade the
  enemy Hero. We're hoping that this leads to more interaction in the laning
  phase, with fewer instances of Misha being able to stand on a point for
  prolonged periods of time while the opposing hero is unable to push her off.
  We know there is a fine line between keeping his unique role on these maps and
  feeling too oppressed when playing against him, so we'll be keeping an eye on
  these changes and will tune as necessary going forward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Xul's rework has arrived! Our goal with these changes
  is primarily to make him feel more like a Diablo Necromancer, and to make his
  Skeletons a larger part of his kit outside of their pushing potential. Xul now
  has the ability to spawn Skeletal Warriors in combat via Spectral Scythe, and
  they now explode for damage when they die, giving enemy Heroes a reason to
  stay away from them while they mow them down. We also updated Xul's talents to
  embrace this fantasy, with many options to use Skeletons as a mechanism to
  deliver various buffs to Xul and debuffs to the enemy team. We had a blast
  testing him, and hope you enjoy him as much as we have!</p>

  originally intended it to be this way to separate it a bit from other similar

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making this change to reduce the amount of time

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our thinking with our Raynor changes in our previous
  patch was to solve a design problem with Ace in the Hole's mandatory synergy
  with Unstable Compound, while simultaneously giving him a bit of a buff
  overall by making his other two talents measure up to its new power. While
  this was largely successful, we underestimated how much more powerful Ace in
  the Hole would become compared to the new, buffed alternatives. We're lowering
  its damage a bit to compensate for the Slow that it gained, which should make

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In regards to his trait, we want optimal play for
  Cho'gall to be to have Gall's Ogre Rage be active most of the time, with
  emergency switches to Cho's Ogre Hide when he is in danger. There are a few
  talents on Cho'galls tree that disincentivize this behavior, which we are
  adjusting now. Calloused Hide in particular was becoming an issue, as players
  have recently been finding it optimal to stay in Ogre Hide for the entire
  game, which removes the gameplay around the trait.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we've looked at Muradin.
  He's been such a staple in the meta for so long that we did not feel he needed
  any large changes. While minor, these buffs should help bring him back into
  the spotlight as a valuable member of any team.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Stitches some love by slightly
  increasing his crowd control capabilities and moving his Level 16 talents to

  to function as a powerful front line Warrior for his team, this should help

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It has been a longstanding request to make Tyrael's

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we made some serious

  functionality into Pinpoint Accuracy, and buffing other talents on the tier to

  picked much more often, and, to our pleasant surprise, isn't winning by a
  large margin over Crystal Aegis. While we like the epic moment of power that
  the current iteration offers, there is understandably a bit of frustration
  with Heroic now. To add some more counter-play, we're reducing its cast range
  and adding more to its cast time to give opponents a better chance to
  interrupt her. Auriel players will now have to choose their moments much more
  wisely if they hope to get a Resurrect off on a key ally who recently died.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Bio-Explosion Switch has always been in a bit of an

  the explosion and a larger Silence duration to the detonation to make up for

  His pick and win rates across his talents are in a better spot, and we believe
  his frustration levels have decreased since the changes. We're being tame with

  way to Slow enemies into Ancestral Strength. We're also buffing Growing
  Nightmare so that it's the premier E talent in an E build, as well as giving
  Lurking Terror some love. Ideally, Lurking Terror can now be used as a more
  unique way to set up Q and W hits on enemies who are far away from Orphea,

<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to the week of March 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be New Toy Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from New Toy Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>

<li>Gaining Unstoppable now prevents and removes Blinds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've read recent feedback that it is strange that
  Silences are removed by the Unstoppable behavior, but Blinds are not. While
  Unstoppable has traditionally been primarily intended to remove effects that
  cause a hero to not be able to control the movement of their character, this
  philosophy gets a little grey when it comes to Silences, as heroes can still
  freely move, but they lose their ability to use movement abilities. In the
  past we decided that it was better for Silences to be removed, but understand
  the argument that Blinds are effectively Silences for auto-attack based
  heroes. We're trying this change to see how it pans out, as Blinds have
  traditionally been very powerful forms of soft CC in our game and this can
  help out heroes that are heavily shut down by them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experience Globes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes who kill Minions with Abilities or Basic Attacks will automatically collect the experience from the Minions.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will no longer time out while travelling to a hero.</li>
<li>They will still expire if the hero moves out of range of the Experience Globe before it reaches them.</li>
<li>Removed a .5 second delay before Experience Globes can be collected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we're excited for the experience globes and the
  increased clarity that they offer in regards to how experience is gained,
  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locust Swarm [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 62 to 68.</li>
<li>Healing increased from 21 to 24.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>

<li><strong>Beetle, Juiced [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Health of Beetles by 20%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These buffs are to some of Anub'arak's talents that
  have been lagging behind their competitors for some time. Beetle, Juiced in
  particular should now be more consistent in its benefit to round out a Beetle-
  oriented build, even if Anub'arak isn't able to get a lot of Basic Attacks off
  on enemy Heroes.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Ogre Hide is active, Cho gains 15% Movement Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Gall's Ogre Rage is active, enemy Heroes who are hit by Gall's Dread Orb have their Healing reduced by 35% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Veil [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor bonus increased from 100% to 200%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since our Old God worshipping Ogre
  has had some love, so we're both buffing up some of Cho's weaker talents as
  well as reducing the time that Surging Fist needs to be channeled in order to
  get a significant charge. This should help make Cho's Q build more viable as
  well as allow him to better reposition himself during teamfights.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Johanna's become a dominant force in the tanking

  Condemn buff.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shield amount reduced from 35% to 30% missing Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It turns out that Deathwing has lived up to his name,
  and has been destroying the Nexus since his release. Cataclysm and Burn
  Beneath My Shadow in particular have proven to be incredibly powerful, so
  we're reducing their effectiveness by a fairly significant amount. In addition
  to these changes, we're reducing the power of some overperforming talents as
  well as slightly nerfing his Destroyer form. Even with these changes, we
  expect Deathwing to continue to be a powerful addition to any team that he's
  on.</p>

<h4 id="thrall">Thrall</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling Thunder [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: [Passive] Increase the number of Chain Lightning bounces by 1. For 8 seconds after hitting an enemy with Chain Lightning, Thrall's next Basic Attack against them grants him a stack of Frostwolf Resilience. If the target is an enemy Hero, then he also deals damage to them equal to 2% of their maximum Health and healing for the same amount.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Echo of the Elements and Crash Lightning are both
  fairly solid talents that have different use cases for when to pick them.
  Rolling Thunder has been less successful, so we're trying something new with
  the talent. We're still keeping its theme of marking targets with Chain
  Lightning and then hitting them for a bonus, but now this bonus will allow
  Thrall to deal bonus damage to enemy Heroes while also interacting with
  Frostwolf Resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frenzy [R3]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer increases Varian's Attack Speed by 15%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Heroic Strike by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't super happy with the power of Frenzy's
  buff, as well as that it asked Varian players to learn a new Basic Attack
  cadence after being used to one speed the whole game. Instead, we're turning
  the Attack Speed bonus into a bonus to his damage over time by buffing Heroic
  Strike instead.</p>

<li>Physical Armor duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Avenger [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Avenging Wrath at maximum charge also increases its damage by 25%.</li>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templar's Verdict [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 6% to 7% maximum Health.</li>

<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>

<li>Range of allied healing increased from 8 to 12.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are mostly looking to buff Yrel's late-
  game by adding more power to her Level 16 talents. We want her to be more
  relevant without dominating the solo lane too much, so we're opting to make
  her Level 16 tier to be an exciting spike for her to hit in her games.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying some fairly significant buffs to
  Resurrect in order to help it better compete with Crystal Aegis. Auriel can
  now Resurrect herself, which should help if she is the focus of the enemy
  team, and her targets will now come back faster and with all of their Health.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Polymorph's range by 30%. If Brightwing hits an enemy Hero with Arcane Flare's center within 2 seconds of being Polymorphed, then reduce Polymorph's cooldown by 7 seconds and gain 50 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last changes to Brightwing have better rounded
  out her talents, however Greater Polymorph was a little too hard to
  consistently proc. Instead of requiring her to hit a Polymorphed target, she
  now has a slightly larger window of time to get the cooldown reduction proc.
  We're also increasing the cooldown reduction bonus from 6 to 7 seconds.</p>

<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bulwark of Light [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Divine Shield is also applied to an allied Hero with the lowest Health near its initial target, and its duration is increased by 1 second.</li>

<li><strong>Divine Hurricane [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 20 to 40 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Protection [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase Devotion's Armor to 40, and its duration by .5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Uther is in a bit of a strange spot at the moment, as
  he has recently had a spike in his win rate, and at higher level play we've
  been seeing him flexed into the main tank role. We think it's pretty cool that
  heroes can sometimes splash into other roles, but in general Uther is
  overperforming, so we're lowering his Health a bit. On an unrelated note,
  similar to Greymane, Uther's Level 20 talents have long been dominated by one
  choice, in this case Redemption. We're giving the other talents on the tier
  some significant buffs so that they can better compete. We hope that this
  won't increase his win rate significantly as Redemption has always been a
  fairly powerful talent, and are prepared to make adjustments if this ends up
  not being the case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are intended to limit Samuro's split-
  pushing capabilities, particularly with Illusion Master, as well as increase
  his presence in teamfights. A good Samuro player can be a bit of a pain to
  deal with, particularly when he's spending most of his time macroing and not
  engaging with the enemy team except to swap to a far away clone. These changes
  should make this scenario happen less often, while also giving Samuro more
  rewarding tools for engaging and fighting the enemy team.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unleashed [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase the damage of Go for the Throat by 25%. If Go for the Throat kills an enemy Hero, reset the cooldown of all of Greymane's abilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gilnean Roulette [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Cursed Bullet by 20 seconds and its damage to 30% of the enemy Hero's current Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tooth and Claw [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Razor Swipe by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For Greymane, we're giving part of Incendiary
  Elixir's cooldown reduction bonus baseline so that the talent gives him some
  baseline power, as well as making it easier for him to complete the quest. In
  addition to this change, we're addressing his Level 20 talent diversity, which
  has not been the best. We're giving 3 of his talents significant buffs so that
  they can compete with Hunter's Blunderbuss, which has traditionally been the
  go-to option. Unleashed now makes it easier to proc Go for the Throat, as well
  as causing those procs to give him significantly more mobility and damage due
  to resetting his cooldowns. For Gilnean Roulette, we're trying the idea of the
  talent changing Cursed Bullet to be more like a 4th Basic Ability that can be
  used multiple times in a teamfight or as a potent poke tool. Finally, Tooth
  and Claw is now also turning Razor Swipe into a significant source of damage.</p>

<p>The next Heroes of the Storm patch has arrived! The update brings a new Hero,
Deathwing the Destroyer, new Experience Globes, new bundles, new skins, and
much more! Dive on in for more information.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly â€“ Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Team Leaders will now be chosen based solely on highest Rank.</strong></span></li>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong>. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong> only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>
</ul></li>

modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Toy 2 Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Toy 2 Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mephisto's talents have been largely unchanged since
  his release. While many of them seem to be in a good spot, some talents and
  talent tiers had some systemic issues that we felt could be improved with some
  changed functionality. We're not looking to overhaul the Mephisto that you
  know and love, but we felt that he could use some new builds to play with.</p>

<li>Attack Speed bonus duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since its removal on many Heroes, Seasoned Marksman
  has fallen off a bit due to needing to be tuned around so many different kits.
  Now that it has a home in fewer places, we're giving it a fairly substantial
  buff to make it more relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathlord has been a fairly awkward talent for a long
  time, providing Arthas with little output and utility, even when going for a Q
  build. We're changing it to now give Arthas a fairly potent Poke tool by
  making it possible for him to infinitely drain the Health of enemy Heroes over
  time if they stay near him, which should only become more powerful as he gets
  his other Q talents as the game goes on.</p>

  now it will Heal her teammates regardless if she removes a status effect or
  not.</p>

  enemies or do things that are engaging for the hero. We're changing the Mana
  bonus portion of the talent to reward Rehgar for playing aggressively, and also
  allowing the talent to better synergize with other Z talents on his tree.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has been performing very well since his
  rework. His W build is still not up to par compared to its competitors, but we
  believe it's very close, so we're slightly nerfing Sticky Wicket while also
  buffing BOOM POW since it's his lynchpin talent to make the W build come
  online. We're also nerfing the damage of RIP-Tire, as it is outperforming
  compared to Rocket Ride, as well as influencing team fights a little much,
  especially when upgraded at Level 20. We like the powerful, game-breaking
  feeling that Extra Oomph provides at Level 20 (the dream is that all talents
  at this stage of the game can feel just as epic), so we're going to hold off
  on nerfing it until we see how this change pans out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As the information can be a bit hidden, we're re-
  evaluating where we have scaling on heroes that deviates from the normal 4%
  per level. While we have some good balance reasons for doing this, Lunara's
  Nature's Toxin was not one of them. Because of this, we're changing its
  scaling to match other heroes, which will result in a decent buff in the
  early-mid game and a very slight nerf to her in the late game. Overall this
  should be a moderate buff for her for most of the game.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing around quite a bit about Zagara, with
  a few goals in mind. Firstly, we believe we went a little far in reducing her
  power in the solo-lane, so we're increasing her Basic Attack damage, which
  will help her throughout the game in a way that enemies should always be able
  to react to and punish her accordingly if she misplays. We're also changing
  around her Level 1 talents to be more universally usable outside of PvE
  scenarios. For Zagara players who want to specialize in Sieging enemy bases,
  Infest will be the go-to talent on the tier, whereas the other talents will be
  more generally useful. Lastly, we're significantly buffing her late-game
  power, but making her Level 16 talents fairly impactful, which should help her
  scale into the late game as a competent damage dealer during team fights.</p>
