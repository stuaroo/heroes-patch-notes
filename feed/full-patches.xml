<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's not a Heroes' patch if we're not changing
  Stukov. We view the Lurking Arm talents as an easier talent path than The Long
  Pitch or Targeted Excision, so we're shifting some power to better reward
  Stukov mastery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan's win rate has consistently settled above our
  preference after the increase in Globe of Annihilation's damage scaling from
  2.5% to 4% per level. So, we're knocking it down a peg. We're also trying to
  diversify how players use Demonic Invasion, so it doesn't feel like the right
  option is to always cast it on enemy Structures.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're overall pleased with Probius' latest warp in
  but found some opportunities to tinker. We're excited for Warp In Pylon's
  change, as aggressive Probius players are given more room to play forward, and
  we don't think we're negatively affecting safer Probius play styles. Plus, who

<p><strong>Building Changes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Healing Wells</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality: Healing Wells are now invulnerable, and are destroyed when their nearby Fort or Keep are destroyed. <span class="text-warning"><strong>Stand alone Healing Wells on Battlefield of Eternity and Braxis Holdout are destroyed when both Keeps are destroyed.</strong></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health increased from 12900 to 15450.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Keeps</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health increased from 17000 to 20050.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Healing Wells function in our
  ARAM game mode, so we're giving it a try everywhere. Additionally, Forts and
  Keeps now have additional health as they've absorbed the health of their
  nearby Healing Wells.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Its been a while since we've made any major changes
  to Rehgar and while his win rates are not worrisome, his identity as a
  flexible generalist healer has suffered as of late. With this rework, we're
  making a number of quality-of-life changes by baselining some of the talents
  that felt mandatory as well as introducing new talents to sharpen his build
  identities. Just to prove that old dogs <strong>can</strong> learn new tricks, we've also
  given Rehgar a new activated trait, Purge, which allows him to micro-cleanse
  an ally or momentarily snare a distant enemy.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sacred Sweep [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cast speed increased by 50%.</li>
<li>Cast finish time increased from 0 to .0625 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swift Sweep [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Burden [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality: Increase Detainment Strike's Stun duration by .25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will of Heaven [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality: Increase Auriel's Basic Attack damage by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wrath of Heaven [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality: Enemy Heroes hit by the center area of Sacred Sweep or the terrain collision of Detainment Strike have their Spell Armor reduced by 10 for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Auriel's Q talents have fallen off in both popularity
  and win rates, so we're baking in the Swift Sweep talent functionality to help
  the abilities' overall efficacy. We're also bumping up some other talents that
  aren't performing well. Similar to Zarya, Auriel's power dynamics can change
  dramatically with even small number tweaks, so we're keeping these changes
  relatively light this time around.</p>

<li>Heal increased from 20 to 25.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Brightwing remains strong at all levels of play, and
  is also terrorizing her foes at higher levels. While this is a substantial
  nerf to Invisible Friends on paper, we feel Brightwing still has compelling
  reasons to take the talent.</p>

<li>Changed Functionality: Blaze of Glory deals additional damage with Valorous Brand marks, but no longer consumes them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Celestial Charge needling enemies a bit more will
  help Imperius out, especially when taking Impaling Light. We're happy with the
  gameplay of the Solarian's Fire build, but we'd rather Imperius continue
  onward rather than go out in a Blaze of Glory.</p>

<li><strong>Winter's Reach [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality: Increase the missile speed of Frostbolt by 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In games where Jaina's team falls behind, we think
  it's harder than it should be to unlock Improved Ice Block, especially when
  Jaina is focused on clearing enemy Minion waves. This should even that out, as
  well as provide a boon for Jaina players that blast away their opponents.
  Blizzard and Cone of Cold talents are competing nicely, so we thought we'd
  provide some quality of life to a Frostbolt talent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Competing against strong Shield Glare talents, Divine
  Fortress' Physical Armor wasn't super appealing. We hope this change provides
  a comparable option for dealing with Physical damage while feeling and playing
  differently. While we're here, we continue to drag part of Hold Your Ground's
  benefit baseline in our endless journey to make the tier more competitive.
  Other than that, we have mild buffs for weak talents, and a whisper of a nerf
  to Heaven's Fury.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has caused more than enough mayhem for now –
  we believe that Big As was making Steel Traps an issue too frequently when

  be keeping an eye on him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Probius has always had high requirements for
  successfully utilizing his abilities. The theme of this update is to turn
  those requirements into benefits, making Probius more approachable while still
  rewarding mastery. While the baseline changes to Warp Rift and Photon Cannon
  affect the identity of these abilities, we hope long time Probius players are
  still able to punish enemy Heroes that underestimate our favorite Probe.</p>

  ARAM game mode, so we're giving it a try everywhere. Additionally, Forts and
  Keeps now have additional health as they've absorbed the health of their
  nearby Healing Wells.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Its been a while since we've made any major changes
  to Rehgar and while his win rates are not worrisome, his identity as a
  flexible generalist healer has suffered as of late. With this rework, we're
  making a number of quality-of-life changes by baselining some of the talents
  that felt mandatory as well as introducing new talents to sharpen his build
  identities. Just to prove that old dogs <strong>can</strong> learn new tricks, we've also
  given Rehgar a new activated trait, Purge, which allows him to micro-cleanse
  an ally or momentarily snare a distant enemy.</p>

<li><strong>Will of Heaven [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functionality: Increase Auriel's Basic Attack damage by 10%.</li>

<li>Additional Functionality: Enemy Heroes hit by the center area of Sacred Sweep or the terrain collision of Detainment Strike have their Spell Armor reduced by 10 for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Auriel's Q talents have fallen off in both popularity
  and win rates, so we're baking in the Swift Sweep talent functionality to help
  the abilities' overall efficacy. We're also bumping up some other talents that
  aren't performing well. Similar to Zarya, Auriel's power dynamics can change
  dramatically with even small number tweaks, so we're keeping these changes
  relatively light this time around.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Brightwing remains strong at all levels of play, and

  nerf to Invisible Friends on paper, we feel Brightwing still has compelling
  reasons to take the talent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Celestial Charge needling enemies a bit more will

  onward rather than go out in a Blaze of Glory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In games where Jaina's team falls behind, we think
  it's harder than it should be to unlock Improved Ice Block, especially when
  Jaina is focused on clearing enemy Minion waves. This should even that out, as
  well as provide a boon for Jaina players that blast away their opponents.
  Blizzard and Cone of Cold talents are competing nicely, so we thought we'd
  provide some quality of life to a Frostbolt talent.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Competing against strong Shield Glare talents, Divine
  Fortress' Physical Armor wasn't super appealing. We hope this change provides
  a comparable option for dealing with Physical damage while feeling and playing
  differently. While we're here, we continue to drag part of Hold Your Ground's
  benefit baseline in our endless journey to make the tier more competitive.
  Other than that, we have mild buffs for weak talents, and a whisper of a nerf
  to Heaven's Fury.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Junkrat has caused more than enough mayhem for now –
  we believe that Big As was making Steel Traps an issue too frequently when
  combined with Gotta Trap ‘Em All! We think the decision between traps that
  demand a Hero's intervention versus many traps is still interesting, but we'll
  be keeping an eye on him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Probius has always had high requirements for
  successfully utilizing his abilities. The theme of this update is to turn
  those requirements into benefits, making Probius more approachable while still
  rewarding mastery. While the baseline changes to Warp Rift and Photon Cannon
  affect the identity of these abilities, we hope long time Probius players are
  still able to punish enemy Heroes that underestimate our favorite Probe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> E.T.C.'s strength has usually been centered around
  his powerful Heroics, but lately that hasn't helped him make the cut. We're
  trying reinforcing that identity with baseline Armor and a buff to Stage Dive
  before we look to broaden his power.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thrall has begun to struggle in solo lane matchups,
  often unable to sustain himself after trading blows. We feel his Mana costs
  are too high due his reliance on frequently casting abilities to charge
  Frostwolf Resilience, even if choosing to learn Mana Tide. There seems to be a
  demand for a strong auto attack talent at 20, with many Thralls choosing Nexus
  Blades, so we're adding Elemental Momentum to keep the tier exciting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Zarya's Basic Attack build is underperforming
  compared to her other options, so we're consolidating a few talents and giving
  her a new one in the form of Deep Burn. Historically, even slight buffs to
  Zarya have had a huge impact on her efficacy, so we're making light touches
  this time around. We'll be keeping a close eye on her performance and making
  more adjustments in the future if needed.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Reactive Ballistospores is just too strong in its

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It can be hard for Maiev to outmaneuver her opponents
  late in the game, so we're excited to see what Maiev players will do with an
  extra charge of Vault of the Wardens. This is also the first time we're adding
  new functionality through a level unlock rather than converting a baseline
  quest or popular talent, so we're interested in your feedback. Additionally,
  Containment Disc has fallen quite a bit behind Warden's Cage at all levels of
  play, so we're adding a Silence to further isolate targets and to interrupt
  big moments.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a hot minute since we touched the Naz man.
  We like that he's a late-game PvE powerhouse, but we feel there's room for him
  to have more PvP impact early on. We're adjusting both his Spider and Toad
  builds to have more of a unique identity and to make them a little more
  consistent. We're also dumping a pile of jungle spices on his 20s to make them
  more competitive with the ever-popular Vile Infection.</p>

  Baneling Barrage is a more interesting ability than from where we started, and
  we have more room for future changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Artanis has long struggled to get value out of his
  swaps when facing heavy CC teams and this has a large impact on his viability,
  especially in higher levels of play. We're giving him a brief window of
  unstoppability after swapping with Phase Prism, as well as improving the
  general usability of the ability. We're also giving him a teensy bit more
  range on his Twin Blades charge. All of these changes combined should help
  Artanis feel a bit more impactful and safe in team fights.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Lt. Morales has been performing well at all
  levels of play, we felt her talents options could use a little spice. We also
  thought it was appropriate to bake in the old "Reinforcements" talent from
  level 20 into the Medivac Dropship Heroic. This should give Morales a little
  more flexibility in shuttling her allies around earlier in the game.</p>

  helps the old bird without overly frustrating his foes.</p>

  level 20s that play into her Zerg style.</p>

<h4 id="blaze">Blaze</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flame Stream [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additionality functionality: Hitting an enemy with both streams of Flame Stream deals 120 damage. This additional hit triggers Flame Stream's Pyromania cooldown reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Habits [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pyromania cooldown reduction from Regeneration Globes reduced from 8 to 6 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossfire [Q]</strong>

<li>Moved from Level 7.</li>
<li>Changed functionality: Ignited Oil Spill damage bonus now granted instantly.</li>
<li>Ignited Oil Spill damage bonus increased from 35% to 45%.</li>
<li>Hero hits for quest completion reduced from 60 to 30.</li>
<li>Quest Reward Ignite duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adhesive Petroleum [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 7.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>(New) Collision Course [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Jet Propulsion deals an additional 325 damage to its collision target.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Crossfire has always been a wildly popular talent, so
  we're bringing it baseline. With this early addition of damage, we're
  comfortable pushing back his damage talent tier and swapping it with his
  impactful tanking talents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4 id="garrosh">Garrosh</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Into the Fray [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 7.</li>
<li>Armor reduced from 25 to 20.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intimidation [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attack Speed reduction reduced from 40% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Oppressor [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Changed from a Passive talent to a Bloodthirst [W] talent.</li>
<li>Spell Power reduction reduced from 40% to 30%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Bloodthirst also applies the Spell Power reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>(New) Lok-tar Ogar! [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increase Into the Fray Armor by 20.</li>
<li>Into the Fray's cooldown is reduced by 12 seconds for each enemy Hero hit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Into the Fray has become a crucial part of what is
  expected from Garrosh, so we're just giving in to the mad Warchief. We're also
  mildly lowering the power of his level 7 talents to make up for this addition.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="johanna">Johanna</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Iron Skin [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield increased from 674 to 810.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold Your Ground [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield percent increase reduced from 60% to 40%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sins Exposed [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduction increased from 25% to 35%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Steed Charge [D]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Sword [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage Increased from 150 to 225.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Fury [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodic damage increased from 12 to 15.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hold Your Ground's talent tier has some competitive
  options, but it still feels more necessary than we'd like. We're baking in
  some of its benefit, and those who love the talent will still have its current
  power - Hold Your Ground's shield is increasing from 1078.4 to 1134. Johanna
  has landed fairly well, so we're also lightly helping some of her weaker
  talents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4 id="muradin">Muradin</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Storm Bolt [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: No longer has a baseline Quest. Upon reaching level 10, Storm Bolt pierces an additional target. Basic Attacks reduce the Cooldown of Storm Bolt by 1 second and restore 3 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect Storm [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: 
<ul>
<li>Quest: Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes increase Storm Bolt's damage by .5.</li>
<li>Quest: If an enemy Hero is killed within 3 seconds of being hit by a Storm Bolt, increase Storm Bolt's damage by 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have never been really happy with Storm Bolt
  having a baseline quest as it causes players to play sub-optimally during the
  early portions of the game while stacking. Instead of removing the power of
  it, we have decided to automatically unlock its functionality when Muradin
  hits level 10. Alongside this change, we also took the opportunity to redesign
  Perfect Storm to reward both aggression and the proper use of Storm Bolt.</p>

<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meat Hook [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing per second reduced from 5% to 4%.</li>
<li>Duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chop Chop [Q/Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Attack Speed bonus reduced from 50% to 40%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Basic Attacks against Heroes refresh the duration.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Additional functionality: Heroes are Slowed by 75% for 1 second after Gorge ends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Master Hooker [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hook cooldown reduction reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Healing reduction reduced from 100% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Stitches is successfully lumbering his way through
  the Nexus in his own way – with a massive health pool and lots of healing. We
  think a small reduction on both ends will be healthy without tripping him up.
  We're also reducing his Hook cooldown reduction on both Serrated Edge and
  Master Hooker, so Stitches will have to work harder to play with his food.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Flash of Anger has overshadowed Imperius' other level
  7 talents for a while, as it was the premier option for both AoE damage and
  survivability. With buffs to both Blaze of Glory and Holy Fervor, along with a
  sizable increase in base power, we hope to see more Imperius action.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning">Experience Globes will no longer time out after 6 seconds. Instead, they will shrink and become worth 25% of their original value for an additional 39 seconds.</span></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are continuously looking for gameplay changes that
  make the game more fun while also educating the player base. This change does
  both - giving teams that missed the crucial 6 second timing window a chance
  for partial redemption while, at the same time, showing players where they are
  missing valuable experience via lane soaking. The team has been enjoying how
  this plays internally and are eager to hear your feedback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Search Term Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are constantly looking for ways of improving the
  player experience. This update should help players in Storm League find whom
  they are looking for. Common terms across the MOBA Genre have been added to
  many heroes allowing players to search for things like Double Soak, Sustain,
  Escape, Camps, Burst, Mage, Stun, CC, etc. Please give the ones listed a try
  and others you may think of. You may find it comes up with something you
  expect. Remember that if you need an alphabetical return you will need to have
  the Alphabetical flag turned on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite large lad is back and hungrier than
  ever! We're giving our best beefy boi a new baseline ability called Shambling
  Horror that should help him saunter in and out of combat a bit more
  consistently. This ability, combined with a plethora of new and reworked
  talents, should make his immediate presence more dangerous. We've also decided
  to bake in the benefits of the old Fishing Hook talent at level 13. This
  talent was simply too fun and effective to the point where it became
  impossible to design reasonable alternatives. We hope the totality of these
  changes will breathe new un-life into a Hero that has fallen out of favor over
  the years.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Previously, The Lost Vikings had received a
  significant buff to their base stats to assist in their adjustment to
  experience globes. The Lost Viking players have since adapted wonderfully, so
  we're halving the impact of that buff, while assisting a few weaker talents.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Lucio has become a dominant force in the hands of

  option, and so we're simply targeting Lucio's personal survivability. We've
  yet to get players to play their Boomboxes, but we'll keep trying.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We don't dislike Uther being capable of playing a

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan's PvE-centric talents are proving a little
  stronger than we'd like for how easy they are to execute on, so we're shaving
  off a little bit of power across the board and greatly reducing the cast range
  of Demonic Invasion. We're also normalizing Globe of Annihilation's level
  scaling since his Q builds are underperforming at most levels of play.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tassadar's Q build is underperforming at higher

  in channel duration doesn't change how quickly the beam begins to travel, and
  instead just allows Tassadar to act sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Search Term Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are constantly looking for ways of improving the
  player experience. This update should help players in Storm League find whom
  they are looking for. Common terms across the MOBA Genre have been added to
  many heroes allowing players to search for things like Double Soak, Sustain,
  Escape, Camps, Burst, Mage, Stun, CC, etc. Please give the ones listed a try
  and others you may think of. You may find it comes up with something you
  expect. Remember that if you need an alphabetical return you will need to have
  the Alphabetical flag turned on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our favorite large lad is back and hungrier than
  ever! We're giving our best beefy boi a new baseline ability called Shambling
  Horror that should help him saunter in and out of combat a bit more
  consistently. This ability, combined with a plethora of new and reworked
  talents, should make his immediate presence more dangerous. We've also decided
  to bake in the benefits of the old Fishing Hook talent at level 13. This
  talent was simply too fun and effective to the point where it became
  impossible to design reasonable alternatives. We hope the totality of these
  changes will breathe new un-life into a Hero that has fallen out of favor over
  the years.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sonya has been overperforming, so she is getting a
  sizable decrease in strength. We're trying something a little different with
  Shattered Ground by separating its existing benefits based on its target, and
  we hope this change is more interesting than simply numerically reducing its
  bonus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Azmodan's PvE-centric talents are proving a little

  of Demonic Invasion. We're also normalizing Globe of Annihilation's level
  scaling since his Q builds are underperforming at most levels of play.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Tassadar's Q build is underperforming at higher

  in channel duration doesn't change how quickly the beam begins to travel, and
  instead just allows Tassadar to act sooner.</p>

  While we're here, we had an excuse to tune up Fire Stomp's later tier talents.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mal'Ganis has fallen off the list of tanks that are
  considered when drafting, and we hope this lift upwards leaves him on more
  solid footing. We also looked to level out the benefit from some
  underperforming talents, in particular Time to Feed now always heals for 80%
  of its previously conditional amount, and has a new bonus for Sleeping
  enemies. That said, Blood Rush has had a mild reduction in duration that
  should not be noticed while fighting, but will increase how often it is reset
  between scuffles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mephisto's Skull Missile talents are underperforming

  consistent baseline and injecting a little more power into its talents.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 2.5 to 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While in a relatively good place, many of Blaze's
  talent tiers have one or two talents that are heavily picked over the third.
  We're trying to shore up the alternate picks to be more competitive, which
  should lead to more unique ways to play the Firebat.</p>

<li>Bonus final Stun damage increased from 125% to 150%.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slushball [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage increased from 50% to 75%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cold Front [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Icing by 4 seconds. If Mei enters her own Blizzard while Icing is active, the cooldown of Icing is reduced by 5 seconds and she gains 80 Mana.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mei has a few talent issues and hasn't been seen in
  the tank meta recently, so we're giving her some buffs, particularly to
  various talents that aren't seeing as much play as they should.</p>

<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 52 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> D.Va's a very unique Hero due to her ability to go in
  and out of her Mech to survive in situations where other Heroes would perish.
  When she's too tanky, she can be overly frustrating due to having to "die"
  twice in order for the enemy team to remove her from the map. We think she's a
  little too beefy in this regard right now, so we're lowering her Mech
  survivability. We're also buffing Bunny Hop's damage so that it better
  competes with Micro Missiles.</p>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Gazlowe is still a little too strong and is seeing an
  overly high participation rate. To tone down his power we're lowering his
  Xplodium Charge damage and reducing the power of some of his highest
  performing talents.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Hogger's release has been incredibly interesting. He
  started low, but his win rate has climbed significantly while perception of
  his potential power also continues to improve. We're looking to do a mix of
  buffs and nerfs to him to largely address looming talent issues while also
  keeping his overall power in check.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We didn't love how Molten Power's strength was
  offered in an upcoming cast after meeting its conditions. This version should
  give a more immediate reward, while also being more attractive for solo
  laners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're experimenting with a change to Light of
  Stormwind to allow for Anduin to have higher highs when using Holy Word:
  Salvation to its full potential. When he gets a full cast off he will now have
  a greatly reduced cooldown, allowing it to be used multiple times in a single

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We liked how Safety Dust boosted all of Brightwing's
  healing tools. However, its healing was overflowing when paired with Phase
  Shift and Hyper Shift, and not in a way we consider exciting. We believe this
  change keeps the core of what makes Safety Dust fun.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Some of Stukov's talents have been too inconsistent

  his overperforming talents to keep his overall power in check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Horrify to no longer be able to be
  interrupted during its cast. It was never intended to have a long cast time,
  and due to its unique setup we've had a lot of bug reports over the years due
  to it being interrupted and being put in a 10-second cooldown, but its sound
  still going off. This change should fix the issue and get rid of the

<li><strong>No Mercy! [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes marked with Grievous Throw deal an additional 2% of their maximum Health as damage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Light tuning to level out Zul'jin talent tiers gave
  us an opportunity for some extra love. It's hard to feel Recklessness'
  benefits as Zul'jin's health lowers so extra quest credit might help it get
  noticed. The consistency of Eye of Zul'jin was hard to beat at Level 13, so
  we've targeted these changes to help Lacerate and Ensnare be more reliable.
  We're comfortable with No Mercy! being a more niche option in response to
  enemy Hero compositions, but it wasn't as strong as it should be even in those
  situations.</p>

<h3 id="new-hero-hogger-scourge-of-elwynn">New Hero: Hogger, Scourge of Elwynn</h3>

<p>Hogger, a chaotic, mobile, bruiser who creates terrain and deals heavy area
damage, now joins the battle in the Nexus!</p>

<p><strong>Trait [D]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Hoard</strong>
<ul>
<li>Throw a pile of junk that deals 102 damage in a small area and acts as terrain for 5 seconds. Upon expiration, a scrap of Meat is dislodged from the Hoard that Hogger can collect to restore 3% of his maximum Health every second for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trait [Passive]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rage is gained by taking damage or dealing Basic Attack damage. Hogger's Basic Ability cooldowns refresh 1% faster for every 2 points of Rage. After 3 seconds of not gaining Rage, it begins to quickly decay.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staggering Blow [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Swing your chain in a wide arc, dealing 140 damage to enemies hit and knocking them away. If an enemy collides with terrain, they are dealt an additional 150 damage, Stunned for .75 seconds, and grant Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 12 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ez-Thro Dynamite [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toss a boot full of Dynamite with a 1.5 second fuse. Upon detonation, enemies take 180 damage and are Slowed by 30% for 2 seconds. The Dynamite instantly detonates when landing directly on an enemy Hero and grants Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hogg Wild [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .25 seconds, become Unstoppable and uncontrollably spin towards the targeted direction, ricocheting off any terrain encountered. Every .25 seconds, deal 36 damage to nearby enemies, increased by 1% for each current point of Rage. Ricocheting off terrain refreshes the duration of the spin.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 14 seconds.</li>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>No longer deals damage to Structures.</strong></span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hoardapult [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Launch an empowered Loot Hoard with Hogger attached, dealing 140 damage and Slowing enemies by 50% for 2 seconds. Hoardapult's Loot Hoard lasts for up to 20 seconds, but decays rapidly while Hogger isn't nearby. Every 10 seconds Hogger can take a chunk of Meat from the Loot Hoard.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shockwave [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .5 seconds, slam the ground, sending out a shockwave that travels in a long line. Enemies hit by the initial slam take 306 damage and are Stunned for 1.25 seconds. Enemies only hit by the shockwave take 210 damage and are Stunned for .75 seconds.</li>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly">Nexus Anomaly</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <br />
  Hello fellow Heroes!  </p>
  
  <p>We've decided to remove our last Seasonal Nexus Anomaly, the Gladiator's
  Medallion. While there were many things that we both did and did not like with
  this experimental change, it wasn't a clear enough win for us to keep it going
  forward.  </p>
  
  <p>We liked how the Medallion gave players some agency over countering CC chains,
  and how it added a new vector of skill expression that was universally
  available to everyone who played the game, no matter which hero or role they
  played as.  </p>
  
  <p>However, over time, we felt that, as a whole, the Medallion took away from
  cool plays more than it added them to the game. Setting up combos with
  teammates is a large part of what makes Heroes of the Storm exciting to both
  play and watch, and having 5 possible instances every 5 minutes of these plays
  not working anymore was taking away a bit too much from the game. We had tried

<h3 id="new-hero-hogger-scourge-of-elwynn">New Hero: Hogger, Scourge of Elwynn</h3>

<p>Hogger, a chaotic, mobile, bruiser who creates terrain and deals heavy area
damage, now joins the battle in the Nexus!</p>

<p><strong>Trait [D]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Hoard</strong>
<ul>
<li>Throw a pile of junk that deals 102 damage in a small area and acts as terrain for 5 seconds. Upon expiration, a scrap of Meat is dislodged from the Hoard that Hogger can collect to restore 3% of his maximum Health every second for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 20 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trait [Passive]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rage is gained by taking damage or dealing Basic Attack damage. Hogger's Basic Ability cooldowns refresh 1% faster for every 2 points of Rage. After 3 seconds of not gaining Rage, it begins to quickly decay.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staggering Blow [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Swing your chain in a wide arc, dealing 140 damage to enemies hit and knocking them away. If an enemy collides with terrain, they are dealt an additional 150 damage, Stunned for .75 seconds, and grant Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 12 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ez-Thro Dynamite [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toss a boot full of Dynamite with a 1.5 second fuse. Upon detonation, enemies take 180 damage and are Slowed by 30% for 2 seconds. The Dynamite instantly detonates when landing directly on an enemy Hero and grants Hogger 10 Rage.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hogg Wild [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .25 seconds, become Unstoppable and uncontrollably spin towards the targeted direction, ricocheting off any terrain encountered. Every .25 seconds, deal 36 damage to nearby enemies, increased by 1% for each current point of Rage. Ricocheting off terrain refreshes the duration of the spin.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 14 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heroic Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hoardapult [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Launch an empowered Loot Hoard with Hogger attached, dealing 140 damage and Slowing enemies by 50% for 2 seconds. Hoardapult's Loot Hoard lasts for up to 20 seconds, but decays rapidly while Hogger isn't nearby. Every 10 seconds Hogger can take a chunk of Meat from the Loot Hoard.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 50 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shockwave [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>After .5 seconds, slam the ground, sending out a shockwave that travels in a long line. Enemies hit by the initial slam take 306 damage and are Stunned for 1.25 seconds. Enemies only hit by the shockwave take 210 damage and are Stunned for .75 seconds.</li>
<li>Cooldown: 70 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talent</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journeyman Cooking [W]</strong>

</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Direct hits launch an additional stack of dynamite beyond the target. Hitting an Ez-Thro Dynamite with Staggering Blow launches 3 sticks of Dynamite.</li>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly">Nexus Anomaly</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> <br />
  Hello fellow Heroes!  </p>
  
  <p>We've decided to remove our last Seasonal Nexus Anomaly, the Gladiator's
  Medallion. While there were many things that we both did and did not like with
  this experimental change, it wasn't a clear enough win for us to keep it going
  forward.  </p>
  
  <p>We liked how the Medallion gave players some agency over countering CC chains,
  and how it added a new vector of skill expression that was universally
  available to everyone who played the game, no matter which hero or role they
  played as.  </p>
  
  <p>However, over time, we felt that, as a whole, the Medallion took away from
  cool plays more than it added them to the game. Setting up combos with
  teammates is a large part of what makes Heroes of the Storm exciting to both
  play and watch, and having 5 possible instances every 5 minutes of these plays
  not working anymore was taking away a bit too much from the game. We had tried
  some other iterations of the Medallion internally to solve this exact problem,
  such as only having it available once per game for each player, but found that
  lowering the frequency too much led to Medallions only being used during the
  last fight, which ended up not hitting the mark for a new feature that should
  made the game better as a whole.  </p>
  
  <p>Despite the issues we have with the Medallion, we believe the idea still has
  some promise, so you may see some more experimentation in the future. We also
  wanted to remind you that we will not be doing seasonal Nexus Anomalies going
  forward. We will, however, continue to iterate and pursue other ways to
  improve Heroes of the Storm, and will release those updates when we feel they
  are ready. As always, thank you so much for playing this game that we all
  love.</p>

  these buffs cause players to give the build another look.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been quite some time since we've had any updates
  to Thrall. Truth be told, his talents have been in a fairly healthy place, so
  we didn't see the need to make adjustments. Even so, we believe these changes
  will make his talent tiers more healthy, and should incentivize some
  alternative ways to play him.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</h3>

<p><strong>Warhead Junction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Layout Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sewage Tunnels have been added to the top and bottom of the Battleground.</li>
<li>The bottom one has replaced the Junk Swarm Host.</li>
<li>An additional Sight Tower has been added below mid lane.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since the release of the Battleground, we have been
  hearing two resounding pieces of feedback: the map is very large and teams
  find it difficult to engage with each other due to the amount of ground needed
  to cover while picking up Warheads, and very often the game either ends up
  being a base-race as each team takes a Junk Swarm Host and tries to push
  opposite lanes to end fastest. To address this we have added a couple of
  Sewage Tunnels (think teleporters) to the map, one of which replaces the
  bottom Junk Swarm Host, and added an additional Sight Tower to allow teams to
  keep an eye on the bottom tunnel. We feel like these changes have been a
  breath of fresh air for Warhead Junction and are excited to hear your
  feedback!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to Anub'arak's Level 20
  talents to make them feel more heroic to take. Currently Rewind is dominating
  this tier due to being both very powerful on its own and fitting Anub'arak's
  kit in a great way. We like this and don't want to take away from it, so we're
  looking to make his other choices also feel great when picked.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Over the years we've nerfed heroes like Dehaka quite
  a bit due to how effective players became at utilizing the power of their
  global presence on large maps. Dehaka has had a lower win-rate for quite some
  time due to this, so we're looking to give him back some of the power he
  previously had.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're generally very happy with where D.Va has landed

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Gazlowe is a little bit too powerful after our last

  on some of his overperforming talents. Overall, he's in a much healthier
  place, and we both desire and expect that he'll be a relevant part of the

  good place but Throwing Shade and Memento Mori have been lesser picked talents

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Despite some other recent buffs, Varian is still a

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We read some feedback that since our global Movement
  Speed increase many patches ago, Alexstrasza has a bit of awkwardness where

  and feel she can use a small buff in general, so we're giving Abundance a
  range increase.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mocking Strikes is slightly underperforming compared

<li>This includes effects for Master of Destruction, Cydaea's Kiss, Hell Rift, and Sin's Grasp.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We saw some feedback that Azmodan's All Shall Burn
  felt awkward due to not getting various procs if the target dies while he is
  channeling on them. This was initially intended by us due to concerns of it
  being too powerful and resulting in some strange moments when playing against
  it, but we've since come around and agree the lack of usability is hurting
  these talents and Azmodan as a whole more than it's helping, so we're going to
  try allowing these procs to occur, even if the target dies.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we updated Falstad, so we
  took a look at him and saw a few talents that could be improved. In general
  many of his talent tiers have two choices that players seem to heavily prefer
  over the third option, so we're trying to create a larger incentive for
  players to think about choosing those talents that they currently aren't

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some functionality changes to some of
  Lunara's talents, particularly when it comes to her Q build, with the aim of
  making their benefits more easily accessible. We're also giving a small range
  increase to Lunara's Basic Attacks to Starwood Spear as a baseline buff for
  picking the talent. While we know the range increase is small, we are nervous
  about giving too much of a range increase to a Hero who has a Movement Speed
  bonus as a baseline feature of the character, so we'll be keeping an eye on
  this buff and will increase the bonus more if we feel it is appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sgt. Hammer hasn't seen large changes for some time,
  particularly to talents like Maelstrom Rounds and Mechanical Know-how. As
  you've probably seen as a theme of this patch, these talents aren't too
  popular so we're helping them out by giving them bonuses that should be more
  consistently achievable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We anticipated that Tychus's early game talents would
  have a shake-up with how much power we added to them, but we had a bit of an
  oversight with Quarterback. While moving a talent from Level 7 to Level 1
  would seem competitive in and of itself, the power we added to its
  alternatives caused the talent to be overshadowed, so we're adding some more
  beef to it and to the W build in general to make it more of a compelling way
  to build Tychus.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>Both The Lost Vikings and Leoric are flooding our RISK team with intentional feeding false positives. To keep ARAM as healthy as possible we are temporarily removing them from the mode.</li>
<li><strong>Map</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep damage to enemy Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've given our tower changes some time to settle,
  and while we like how their current targeting mechanism works, we believe we
  went a little too far in lowering their damage. We're giving them some of
  their teeth back so that enemies who tower dive have a little less time to
  hang around in their opponent's base before they have to disengage.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Healing Fountains</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health and Shield values swapped. The Shield value now accounts for 75% of the total Health.</li>
<li>Shield regeneration rate increased to 10% of total Shields per second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players dislike how their
  Healing Fountains can be sniped by the opposing team early in the game. While
  we agree that this can be frustrating, we don't want to completely remove
  alternative strategies for creating an advantage. We're experimenting with a
  change to move the total Health of the Healing Fountains to be much more in
  favor of a Shield that quickly regenerates instead of Health. This should make
  it riskier for players to snipe Healing Fountains, as they will not get any
  value unless they destroy the building, while also rewarding players who are
  able to protect their Healing Fountains early in the game.</p>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2100 to 2150.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration increased from 4.38 to 4.48.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Level 13 talents have been changed to follow our normal talent ordering conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Burning Beetles [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage dealt by Beetles reduced from 7 to 6.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debilitation [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Enemy Heroes hit by Burrow Charge or Impale have their Spell Power reduced by 50% for 4 seconds.</li>

<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Beetles gain 30% increased Health. Every 4th Basic Attack spawns a Beetle.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Historically Anub'arak has always been on a razor's
  edge of being wildly popular and powerful or not part of the meta with small
  changes having a large effect on his perception. We're giving him a small
  Health buff and some adjustments to his late-game talents, which we believe
  will bring him more to the forefront again as a powerful initiator for his
  team.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduction duration reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we like the somewhat chaotic, raid-boss feel of
  Enraged Regeneration and its healing debuff, we believe its duration is too
  long for how often the debuff can be applied to enemies, particularly at later
  stages of the game due to its synergies with talents like Twilight Nova.
  Because of this, we're heavily reducing its duration so that enemy Healers
  have larger windows of opportunity to play around its debuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eternal Flames [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Fire Stomp by 1 second.</li>
<li>Mana return when Stunning enemy Heroes with Shadow Charge or Overpower increased from 35 to 45.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Diabolical Momentum [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces the cooldown of Fire Stomp.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hellfire [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus Spell Power per stack increased from 2% to 3%.</li>
<li>Maximum stacks for bonus damage per second to nearby enemies reduced from 15 to 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo has recently risen in the ranks to once again
  being a high demand Warrior for his team. Overall, his talents are in a fairly
  good place, but we want to fix a design issue where Diabolical Momentum is
  simply too good at doing everything since it has synergy with all of his other
  potential ways of playing. To reduce its power and help his Level 7 tier be
  more diverse, we're removing its ability to reduce the cooldown of Fire Stomp
  and giving Eternal Flames a boost in its role as a key talent for players who
  want to build around the ability.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> E.T.C. continues to be a force to be reckoned with as
  a highly popular front-line member of teams. We're reducing his overall
  survivability by nerfing Rockstar's Armor amount so that he is punished more
  for missing his Stun or overextending during teamfights.</p>

<li>Meteor damage increased from 65 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Currently, particularly at higher levels of play,
  many players are favoring Destroyer form over World Breaker. We're moving some
  power from Destroyer Form into Worldbreaker to incentivize players to switch
  between forms more often as the situation demands. We also believe the energy
  buff to Worldbreaker form makes more sense for Deathwing, as he is naturally
  more incentivized to use Molten Flame in this form after using his other
  abilities to control opponents' movements in choke points, but would often
  find himself unable to use Molten Flame as often due to being at low energy
  after using his other abilities to set it up.</p>

<li>Requirement for Armor and Movement Speed Slow to activate reduced from 1.5 to 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> D.Va has come out swinging with her new rework, and
  while she is still within our normally acceptable bounds of performance, she
  is at the upper end and we feel she can use a little toning down. We're
  reducing her Basic Attack damage as a baseline nerf and lowering the power of
  Rush Down, which should bring in line many of the more powerful and popular
  ways to play her. We still want and expect her to be a force to be reckoned
  with and will be keeping an eye on her to see if more tuning changes are
  needed down the road.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Gazlowe came out a bit low with his rework, so we're
  pulling back on a lot of nerfs that were made during the design process which
  were done with the fear that he would be too powerful. We believe these
  changes to both his base kit and to underperforming talents will bring him up
  to par with other Bruisers, and, similar to D.Va, solidify his place as an
  effective member of his team.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Kerrigan's talent tiers generally have one talent
  that most people are using, followed by the other two talents on the tier
  having decent parity. We're giving some buffs to her alternate talents to
  become more attractive choices, which should allow for more diverse ways to
  play her.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Samuro is a difficult Hero to use that has gotten a

  his niche status, he has slightly gone over the edge of what we believe to be
  a little too powerful and frustrating to play against, so we're reducing the

<li>With the Patch H.52, we're replacing Heroes Brawl mode with the new ARAM - All Random All Mid mode.</li>
<li><strong>ARAM mode key features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The map pool for ARAM mode consists of four one-lane maps.</li>
<li>There are no additional objectives on the ARAM maps: destroy the enemy's Core to win.</li>
<li>As match starts, every player must pick one out of three randomly selected heroes. Think fast: you have only 30 seconds!</li>
<li>Hearthstones are disabled, and starting area does not regenerate health.</li>
<li>Unlike Heroes Brawl, there's no dedicated Weekly Quest exclusive to this mode. Instead, ARAM games contribute to Daily Quests and Special Event Quests progress.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Upon reviewing the time commitment required on average for players to obtain seasonal quest rewards, we've made the decision to lower the requirements from 50 games to 35 games. We believe the lowering of this requirement should help Storm League to be more approachable to a larger portion of players, as they will not have to devote as much time each season to obtain their rewards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> At long last, our favorite Pro Gamer is back and ready to pwn teh n00bs! With D.Va's rework we've given her tons of new tools and redistributed her power to help her fill more of a traditional bruiser role while still retaining a lot of her "supporty" essence. This new talent tree should allow her to flex to fill gaps in your team comp or to be her old aggro self. Her old Heroic option, Big Shot, is now baseline and has been replaced with Micro Missiles, giving her Mech some reach and soft CC that she didn't have before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our resident one man wrecking crew is receiving a fairly large revamp, designed to fully embrace him as a formidable Bruiser, acting as a front-line member of his team who specializes in disruption and zone control. He now sports a new resource system with Scrap, as well as some design changes to both Deth Lazor and Xplodium Charge, which should make them more consistently useful throughout the course of the game. We had a blast tinkering with our favorite Goblin, and hope you also enjoy what we've done with him!</p>
