<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>Both The Lost Vikings and Leoric are flooding our RISK team with intentional feeding false positives. To keep ARAM as healthy as possible we are temporarily removing them from the mode.</li>
<li><strong>Map</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep damage to enemy Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've given our tower changes some time to settle,
  and while we like how their current targeting mechanism works, we believe we
  went a little too far in lowering their damage. We're giving them some of
  their teeth back so that enemies who tower dive have a little less time to
  hang around in their opponent's base before they have to disengage.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Healing Fountains</strong>
<ul>
<li>Health and Shield values swapped. The Shield value now accounts for 75% of the total Health.</li>
<li>Shield regeneration rate increased to 10% of total Shields per second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players dislike how their
  Healing Fountains can be sniped by the opposing team early in the game. While
  we agree that this can be frustrating, we don't want to completely remove
  alternative strategies for creating an advantage. We're experimenting with a
  change to move the total Health of the Healing Fountains to be much more in
  favor of a Shield that quickly regenerates instead of Health. This should make
  it riskier for players to snipe Healing Fountains, as they will not get any
  value unless they destroy the building, while also rewarding players who are
  able to protect their Healing Fountains early in the game.</p>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2100 to 2150.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration increased from 4.38 to 4.48.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li>Level 13 talents have been changed to follow our normal talent ordering conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Burning Beetles [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage dealt by Beetles reduced from 7 to 6.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debilitation [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Enemy Heroes hit by Burrow Charge or Impale have their Spell Power reduced by 50% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beetle, Juiced [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Beetles gain 30% increased Health. Every 4th Basic Attack spawns a Beetle.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Historically Anub'arak has always been on a razor's
  edge of being wildly popular and powerful or not part of the meta with small
  changes having a large effect on his perception. We're giving him a small
  Health buff and some adjustments to his late-game talents, which we believe
  will bring him more to the forefront again as a powerful initiator for his
  team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduction duration reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we like the somewhat chaotic, raid-boss feel of
  Enraged Regeneration and its healing debuff, we believe its duration is too
  long for how often the debuff can be applied to enemies, particularly at later
  stages of the game due to its synergies with talents like Twilight Nova.
  Because of this, we're heavily reducing its duration so that enemy Healers
  have larger windows of opportunity to play around its debuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eternal Flames [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Fire Stomp by 1 second.</li>
<li>Mana return when Stunning enemy Heroes with Shadow Charge or Overpower increased from 35 to 45.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Diabolical Momentum [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer reduces the cooldown of Fire Stomp.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hellfire [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus Spell Power per stack increased from 2% to 3%.</li>
<li>Maximum stacks for bonus damage per second to nearby enemies reduced from 15 to 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Diablo has recently risen in the ranks to once again
  being a high demand Warrior for his team. Overall, his talents are in a fairly
  good place, but we want to fix a design issue where Diabolical Momentum is
  simply too good at doing everything since it has synergy with all of his other
  potential ways of playing. To reduce its power and help his Level 7 tier be
  more diverse, we're removing its ability to reduce the cooldown of Fire Stomp
  and giving Eternal Flames a boost in its role as a key talent for players who
  want to build around the ability.</p>

<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 6% to 5%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> E.T.C. continues to be a force to be reckoned with as
  a highly popular front-line member of teams. We're reducing his overall
  survivability by nerfing Rockstar's Armor amount so that he is punished more
  for missing his Stun or overextending during teamfights.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Firestorm [Z]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meteor damage increased from 65 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Currently, particularly at higher levels of play,
  many players are favoring Destroyer form over World Breaker. We're moving some
  power from Destroyer Form into Worldbreaker to incentivize players to switch
  between forms more often as the situation demands. We also believe the energy
  buff to Worldbreaker form makes more sense for Deathwing, as he is naturally
  more incentivized to use Molten Flame in this form after using his other
  abilities to control opponents' movements in choke points, but would often
  find himself unable to use Molten Flame as often due to being at low energy
  after using his other abilities to set it up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Requirement for Armor and Movement Speed Slow to activate reduced from 1.5 to 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> D.Va has come out swinging with her new rework, and
  while she is still within our normally acceptable bounds of performance, she
  is at the upper end and we feel she can use a little toning down. We're
  reducing her Basic Attack damage as a baseline nerf and lowering the power of
  Rush Down, which should bring in line many of the more powerful and popular
  ways to play her. We still want and expect her to be a force to be reckoned
  with and will be keeping an eye on her to see if more tuning changes are
  needed down the road.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Gazlowe came out a bit low with his rework, so we're
  pulling back on a lot of nerfs that were made during the design process which
  were done with the fear that he would be too powerful. We believe these
  changes to both his base kit and to underperforming talents will bring him up
  to par with other Bruisers, and, similar to D.Va, solidify his place as an
  effective member of his team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Samuro is a difficult Hero to use that has gotten a
  lot of mileage for those who take the time to learn how to play him. Despite
  his niche status, he has slightly gone over the edge of what we believe to be
  a little too powerful and frustrating to play against, so we're reducing the
  power of a couple overperforming talents as well as how slippery he is to
  catch and kill once caught out.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In our efforts to make a more competitive build, we
  went a little overboard with our recent buffs to Gall's Dread Orb talents.

  him as well as increase his talent diversity.</p>

  Intellect should now be a fairly viable Mana-restoring talent for players who
  don't want to pick Fingers of Frost at Level 1, which should open more

<li><strong>Introducing ARAM Mode</strong>

<li>With the Patch H.52, we're replacing Heroes Brawl mode with the new ARAM - All Random All Mid mode.</li>
<li><strong>ARAM mode key features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The map pool for ARAM mode consists of four one-lane maps.</li>
<li>There are no additional objectives on the ARAM maps: destroy the enemy's Core to win.</li>
<li>As match starts, every player must pick one out of three randomly selected heroes. Think fast: you have only 30 seconds!</li>
<li>Hearthstones are disabled, and starting area does not regenerate health.</li>
<li>Unlike Heroes Brawl, there's no dedicated Weekly Quest exclusive to this mode. Instead, ARAM games contribute to Daily Quests and Special Event Quests progress.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Upon reviewing the time commitment required on average for players to obtain seasonal quest rewards, we've made the decision to lower the requirements from 50 games to 35 games. We believe the lowering of this requirement should help Storm League to be more approachable to a larger portion of players, as they will not have to devote as much time each season to obtain their rewards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> At long last, our favorite Pro Gamer is back and ready to pwn teh n00bs! With D.Va's rework we've given her tons of new tools and redistributed her power to help her fill more of a traditional bruiser role while still retaining a lot of her "supporty" essence. This new talent tree should allow her to flex to fill gaps in your team comp or to be her old aggro self. Her old Heroic option, Big Shot, is now baseline and has been replaced with Micro Missiles, giving her Mech some reach and soft CC that she didn't have before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our resident one man wrecking crew is receiving a fairly large revamp, designed to fully embrace him as a formidable Bruiser, acting as a front-line member of his team who specializes in disruption and zone control. He now sports a new resource system with Scrap, as well as some design changes to both Deth Lazor and Xplodium Charge, which should make them more consistently useful throughout the course of the game. We had a blast tinkering with our favorite Goblin, and hope you also enjoy what we've done with him!</p>

<ul>
<li>The map pool for ARAM mode consists of four one-lane maps.</li>
<li>There are no additional objectives on the ARAM maps: destroy the enemy's Core to win.</li>

<li>Hearthstones are disabled, and starting area does not regenerate health.</li>
<li>Unlike Heroes Brawl, there's no dedicated Weekly Quest exclusive to this mode. Instead, ARAM games contribute to Daily Quests and Special Event Quests progress.</li>

<p>Seasonal Quest Line win requirements have been reduced in Season 4.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Steps and Rewards in Season 4 of 2020</strong>
<ul>
<li>5 Wins: Craft Wars Chest</li>
<li>10 Wins: Rare Craft Wars Chest</li>
<li>20 Wins: Epic Craft Wars Chest</li>
<li>35 Wins: Tamed Ravasaur Mount</li>
<li>35 Wins: Eligibility for End of Season 4 Rewards and Grand Master Leaderboards</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>The final reward of the 2020 Season 4 Questline will be the Tamed Ravasaur Mount, which will be awarded after winning 35 games in Ranked Play.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Upon reviewing the time commitment required on
  average for players to obtain seasonal quest rewards, we've made the decision
  to lower the requirements from 50 games to 35 games. We believe the lowering
  of this requirement should help Storm League to be more approachable to a
  larger portion of players, as they will not have to devote as much time each
  season to obtain their rewards.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Alarak has fallen off a bit due to a few rounds of

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Surge of Light continues to dominate Cassia's Level 7

  increasing how much damage she is required to take before she is able to use

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> At long last, our favorite Pro Gamer is back and
  ready to pwn teh n00bs! With D.Va's rework we've given her tons of new tools
  and redistributed her power to help her fill more of a traditional bruiser
  role while still retaining a lot of her "supporty" essence. This new talent
  tree should allow her to flex to fill gaps in your team comp or to be her old
  aggro self. Her old Heroic option, Big Shot, is now baseline and has been
  replaced with Micro Missiles, giving her Mech some reach and soft CC that she
  didn't have before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our resident one man wrecking crew is receiving a
  fairly large revamp, designed to fully embrace him as a formidable Bruiser,
  acting as a front-line member of his team who specializes in disruption and
  zone control. He now sports a new resource system with Scrap, as well as some
  design changes to both Deth Lazor and Xplodium Charge, which should make them
  more consistently useful throughout the course of the game. We had a blast
  tinkering with our favorite Goblin, and hope you also enjoy what we've done
  with him!</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last round of buffs have done a lot to bring

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Howling Blast has been the same for a very long time,
  almost since the inception of our game. Many things have changed since then,
  and we believe a range increase is warranted due to how average ranges of
  various abilities and effects have changed since that time.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we achieved our previous goal of making
  Incinerator Gauntlets a powerful PvE option, we overshot a bit and are
  reducing its power to be more in line with what other Warriors can bring to
  the table in this area.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encore [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemy Heroes knocked back by Face Melt or the Amp reduce E.T.C.'s Heroic cooldown by 8%.</li>

<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Slow amount of Stage Dive by 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We were a little hesitant to make talent changes to
  E.T.C. due to how well he has been performing, even though we felt he could
  use some help in that department. We don't believe that holding off
  indefinitely on needed talent improvements just because a Hero is performing
  well serves our Heroes in the best way over the long term, so we're making
  these improvements and will adjust accordingly once we see how they settle.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We are super happy with where Mei is sitting overall,
  but wanted to continue tuning some talents to help even things out. While
  doing so, we also increased the cooldown of Avalanche substantially, as it
  feels like she has too much up-time on its availability in team fights.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It was not our intention that Muradin have more Mana
  tension when his baseline quest for Storm Bolt was completed. Since Muradin
  already has a decent amount of Mana tension, we felt it was appropriate that
  this was lessened once he completes his quest.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Chen some small buffs that we believe
  are warranted to help out his ability to pressure enemies as well as beef up
  some underperforming talents. We don't expect these changes to drastically
  change how he plays, but they should help him perform better in the laning
  phase and give him some extra power to look forward to in later parts of the
  game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We want Safety in Numbers to be a more consistent
  talent to get value out of, so we're lowering the requirement for Deckard to
  be near only 2 friendly Heroes instead of 3, and slightly lowering its bonus
  to compensate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Tyrande a baseline Healing buff as well
  as making her W build more synergistically powerful. To compensate, we're
  slightly reducing Harsh Moonlight's power, though we still believe it will
  still be an incredibly strong talent, particularly when paired with Ranger at
  Level 1.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tyr's Deliverance [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase the damage and healing of Holy Radiance by 10%. Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes cause Uther's next cast of Holy Radiance to have its damage and healing increased by an additional 10%, stacking up to 4 times.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Uther's weakness to Poke and persistent AoE
  damage is intended, we feel he's a little too sharp in this direction, which
  too often disincentivizes players from running him as a Healer on his team.
  We're making him a bit better in this regard while also improving a couple of
  his Level 16 talents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some simple talent changes that should
  help Qhira's tiers be more competitive. Siphoning link in particular should be
  a lot more attractive now that it provides a bonus that is not reliant on
  hitting her Revolving Sweep, which is on a fairly long cooldown.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While more in-line after the past couple of balance
  changes, there were still a couple talents we wanted to address. Surge of
  Light is still slightly over-performing, while Power Strike needed something
  to give it a bit more punch. Lowering the damage of Surge of Light and giving
  a small cooldown reduction functionality to Power Strike should shift both
  talents into a better spot overall.</p>

  Gauntlets to an earlier level and removing the effect of causing Basic Attacks
  to light Oil Spills and adding it to Adhesive Petroleum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some of Cho's talents more usable and
  experimenting with moving The Will of Cho to be a Level 1 questing talent. We
  like the talent, but it was coming online late into the game where he often
  couldn't get much value out of it. We believe this iteration will give it more
  use cases, particularly when matched against the other talents on the tier.</p>

  Recently he has fallen off a bit compared to his peers, but we don't believe
  he is too far off. We think he can benefit from a buff to Thunder Clap's

  Storm Bolt hits as well as allow him to better counter enemies who rely on
  Basic Attacks for effectiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For a long time we have held to the belief that one
  important aspect of what makes Johanna special is her ability to provide more
  wave clear for her team compared to other Warriors. While this is true, it has
  gotten to the point that it has begun to limit what kinds of effective team
  compositions can be made, as any team that wants to run heroes that don't have
  a lot of wave clear really need Johanna to be competitive. To help open up
  more possible team compositions and to give Stitches a needed buff, we're
  experimenting with giving him comparable wave clear, which also has the side
  effect that he should be able to land more Hooks due to the enemy Minions
  dying faster. We're also removing our last Health buff that we gave him, as we
  believe leaning into this direction of giving him more wave clear and buffing
  his Hook range are more unique ways to bring Stitches to the forefront of
  Warriors that players want to bring to their team.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Safeguard's benefit has largely diminished over time

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we got Bloodlust in a good place in regards to

  larger opportunity to play around its powerful buff, as it makes effects like
  Stuns, Blinds, and Attack Speed Slows more significant when it comes to
  surviving the burst of power that it gives to his team.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that

<h3 id="event">Event</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexomania II Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nexomania II is the summer event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of June 23 to week of September 7, PDT.</li>
<li>One of the most prestigious stops on the Nexomania circuit is the Intermultiversal Nexoweight Championship: No rules, no mercy, just nonstop, bicep-busting carnage. This time, many fans expected Mal'gaucho Mal'Ganis to win it all. The Swingin' Scourge of Stratholme tore a bloody path through his side of the bracket, burying opponents beneath a deluge of demonic blows. But on the other side of the bracket, a mysterious upstart known only as La Gata de Batalla has proven herself a worthy challenger, defeating foes many times her size en route to the championship match. The arena is packed, with Nexomania legend MC Tombstone roaring away on the mic, and the final battle is about to begin. Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Nexomania II event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Nexomania II Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Nexomania II Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' summer events limited-time loot chests!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become Nexomania II Loot Chests.</li>

<h3 id="storm-league">Storm League</h3>

<p>With the upcoming third Season of 2020, we wanted to make some changes to the
reward structure of Storm League.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Gold Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Season 3 of 2020, we are removing all Gold rewards from Storm League, End of Season prizes and Seasonal Questlines. This will also affect Season 2 rewards. The new Seasonal Questline reward structure is as follows: a Nexomania II Chest after 5 wins, a Rare Nexomania II Chest after 15 wins, and an Epic Nexomania II Chest after 30 wins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the inception of Storm League, we have received a lot of feedback about the retirement of Ranked Play reward Mounts. We have heard you and are extremely happy to announce the return of exclusive Storm League Mounts starting next season. The ultimate and final reward of the 2020 Season 3 Questline will be the Regal Tiger Mount, which will be awarded after winning 50 games in Ranked Play.</li>
<li>As of Season 3, you won't have to wait for the end of the Season to claim your well-earned Regal Tiger. It will become available as soon as you complete the four-step Storm League Quest Line. The mount only requires you to win 50 games and will be granted to players in all Leagues and Divisions.</li>
<li>As usual, we're happy to listen to your feedback. Please share your thoughts with us, so we can continue to adjust and evolve the Storm League rewards further.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our main goal with these changes is to make
  Mal'Ganis's talent tree as a whole more interesting and impactful. While we
  need to slightly nerf his base kit to keep him at a similar relative strength
  compared to other Warriors, we believe these changes will overall leave him in
  a powerful state while also giving players more expression in how they want to
  play Mal'Ganis in regards to his survivability and in how he controls the flow
  of battle.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Murky's Spawn Egg to have the standard
  4% scaling that is present in most other places throughout the game. This is a
  buff to the egg's Health for most of the game, with its Health value being the
  same as its current level at around the Level 20 mark.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Firstly, thank you all for the overwhelming amount of
  feedback related to the Call for Help Anomaly. We appreciate the time you took
  to write out your responses, and it greatly helped us make a decision on where
  to go going forward. In regards to the changes, we decided to keep the tower
  aggro system with some adjustments. To help reward aggression in the laning
  phase of the game, we are removing both the negative Armor debuff that front
  towers used to provide and also reverting their aggro systems to no longer
  prioritize Heroes who attack other Heroes in their range. Forts, Keeps, and
  the Core will still prioritize enemy Heroes who attack other Heroes, which
  will make them stand out as important structures to both defend and take down.
  We will continue to monitor how these changes play out, and will adjust these
  systems more in the future if we believe it to be necessary.</p>

<li><strong>New Nexus Anomaly - Climate Phenomena</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Strange weather disturbances have been spotted across the Nexus, with realms
experiencing rain storms, snow flurries, and foggy mists! Mei's arrival is
just in time to help analyze and study these strange weather conditions that
have begun occurring. Climate Phenomena is our newest Nexus Anomaly, bringing
a variety of fun weather effects to the game. Each battleground has a specific
type of weather event that will occur periodically. Each weather event lasts
for a few minutes at a time before clearing up. This cycle will repeat
periodically until the game ends. While these weather events are active,
Heroes can gain a unique buff based on the type of active weather. These buffs
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rain Storms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Periodically strike all heroes with lightning, increasing Movement Speed and granting a Lightning Shield that damages nearby enemies. 
<ul>
<li>Movement Speed increased by 25%.</li>
<li>Damage nearby enemies for 64 damage per second.</li>
<li>Buff lasts 8 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Snow Flurries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes accumulate a small shield over time while out of combat. 
<ul>
<li>Shield starts at 28 and slowly accumulates up to 224.</li>
<li>Shield lasts until destroyed or until the Snow stops falling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foggy Mists</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows Heroes to gain Stealth after standing in shrubs for a few seconds. 
<ul>
<li>After standing in a shrub for 1.5 seconds, Heroes gain Stealth.</li>
<li>Stealth lasts 40 seconds or until attacking, taking damage, using an ability, or until the Foggy weather dissipates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Weather events will be active on these Battlegrounds:</p>

<ul>

<h3 id="event">Event</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexomania II Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nexomania II is the summer event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of June 23 to week of September 7, PDT.</li>
<li>One of the most prestigious stops on the Nexomania circuit is the Intermultiversal Nexoweight Championship: No rules, no mercy, just nonstop, bicep-busting carnage. This time, many fans expected Mal'gaucho Mal'Ganis to win it all. The Swingin' Scourge of Stratholme tore a bloody path through his side of the bracket, burying opponents beneath a deluge of demonic blows. But on the other side of the bracket, a mysterious upstart known only as La Gata de Batalla has proven herself a worthy challenger, defeating foes many times her size en route to the championship match. The arena is packed, with Nexomania legend MC Tombstone roaring away on the mic, and the final battle is about to begin. Whose side are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Nexomania II event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Nexomania II Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Nexomania II Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' summer events limited-time loot chests!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Loot Chests earned prior to the start of this event will not become Nexomania II Loot Chests.</li>

<h3 id="storm-league">Storm League</h3>

<p>With the upcoming third Season of 2020, we wanted to make some changes to the
reward structure of Storm League.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Gold Rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Season 3 of 2020, we are removing all Gold rewards from Storm League, End of Season prizes and Seasonal Questlines. This will also affect Season 2 rewards. The new Seasonal Questline reward structure is as follows: a Nexomania II Chest after 5 wins, a Rare Nexomania II Chest after 15 wins, and an Epic Nexomania II Chest after 30 wins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storm League Reward Mounts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the inception of Storm League, we have received a lot of feedback about the retirement of Ranked Play reward Mounts. We have heard you and are extremely happy to announce the return of exclusive Storm League Mounts starting next season. The ultimate and final reward of the 2020 Season 3 Questline will be the Regal Tiger Mount, which will be awarded after winning 50 games in Ranked Play.</li>
<li>As of Season 3, you won't have to wait for the end of the Season to claim your well-earned Regal Tiger. It will become available as soon as you complete the four-step Storm League Quest Line. The mount only requires you to win 50 games and will be granted to players in all Leagues and Divisions.</li>
<li>As usual, we're happy to listen to your feedback. Please share your thoughts with us, so we can continue to adjust and evolve the Storm League rewards further.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our main goal with these changes is to make
  Mal'Ganis's talent tree as a whole more interesting and impactful. While we
  need to slightly nerf his base kit to keep him at a similar relative strength
  compared to other Warriors, we believe these changes will overall leave him in
  a powerful state while also giving players more expression in how they want to
  play Mal'Ganis in regards to his survivability and in how he controls the flow
  of battle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Murky's Spawn Egg to have the standard
  4% scaling that is present in most other places throughout the game. This is a
  buff to the egg's Health for most of the game, with its Health value being the
  same as its current level at around the Level 20 mark.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Call For Help - Balance Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep damage to enemy Heroes reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Maximum Armor reduction from Structures reduced from -40 to -20.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Thank you for your discussions and feedback regarding
  the Call For Help system. We've seen a trend that players believe towers are
  still too punishing to dive under for lengthy periods of time, so we're going
  to reduce their damage as well as how powerful their Armor debuff is so that
  players are more incentivized to make aggressive plays when pushing. We'll be
  continuing to keep an eye on how these changes unfold, so please continue to
  give us your feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Anub'arak is slightly underperforming compared to
  other Warriors. We believe his survivability could use a little boost, so
  we're increasing the Shield amount of Harden Carapace, which should make him
  even better at surviving burst damage, particularly from Abilities.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> The two defining unique attributes to Stitches are
  his ability to displace enemies from long range and his incredibly high Health
  pool that he is able to manipulate with Devour and various talent
  interactions. We're doubling down in his Health pool in this buff, which
  should let him stick around even longer in teamfights to harass enemies and
  protect his teammates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since we last changed the Lost
  Vikings. This round of changes is targeted at making the Lost Vikings
  significantly more potent in PvP situations while keeping their map pressure
  in check. There are a few talents in particular that will give the Vikings
  powerful benefits when they fight together, which should reward players who

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're changing Farseer's Blessing to have a more
  universally powerful effect by having it proc a second time after its initial
  cast. This should give Ancestral Healing a lot more flexibility in its use
  cases since it can now save a single ally over a long period of time or

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Genji has posted a low overall win rate for some

  players, the skill requirement to be effective on him is a little too high for
  the vast majority of players. We're slightly buffing his health and reducing
  his overall mobility with Cyber Agility, in addition to buffing a few of his
  underperforming talents. This should move him into a better place,

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tower, Fort, and Keep structure damage reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Structures will only focus their attacks on enemy Heroes if they attack an allied Hero who is also in their range.</li>
<li>Self-damage from Heroes will no longer cause structures to focus them.</li>
<li>Periodic damage over time will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some changes to the Call for Help system
  that should help the overall player experience. We believe that currently
  Towers are punishing aggressive play too much, so we're lowering their damage
  to give diving Heroes more time to make plays before they have to escape. Our
  goal overall with the system is to still have aggressive play be possible and
  rewarded, but to also give the defending team a way to punish prolonged Tower
  dives, which is primarily due to the stacking Armor debuff. We're also
  changing the A.I. of structures to require that both the attacking and
  defending Hero be in their range in order for them to switch aggro onto an
  aggressor. This means that the defending Hero needs to also be near their
  structures in order to be defended, and it removes some unintuitive situations
  where a Hero can get aggro from attacks that are happening in far away places.
  Lastly, periodic damage will no longer cause structures to focus Heroes, so
  Heroes like Lunara will no longer pull aggro for the entirety of their DoT
  effects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback that players believe the pushing
  Samurai camp is too strong and the objective is too weak. For some insight, we
  purposefully designed the map so that the Samurai camp was uniquely powerful,
  and we wanted it to be a viable, effective strategy that was available for a
  large portion of the game, particularly since the map only has 2 lanes. Now
  that the map has been out for some time, we believe that the balance of power
  can shift a little in favor of the objective being a more central way to win
  the game.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Sustaining Power has been a difficult sell as a

  more inclined to go for Extended Lightning, since it adds more benefits that
  synergize with later talents. Instead of buffing Sustaining Power in hopes
  that it outshines Extended Lightning, we're changing it to do its own unique
  effect. Overwhelming Power should synergize well with talents like Hindered
  Motion and Mocking Strikes, allowing Alarak players who are able to stick to
  their targets to do a lot of sustained damage while keeping themselves alive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since her release, Cassia has been a great counter-
  pick against teams bringing multiple Basic Attackers. When she was being
  created, the Hero Designer was working closely with the Live Design team to
  find a good niche for her to fill. Since that time, however, our design
  philosophies have changed, and you have been seeing us pull-back from any
  individual Hero being too sharp in their designs. The War Matron is no
  exception and her rework tries to keep her original playstyle intact while
  also opening up options for players to bring her into more team compositions.
  Our other goals with the rework were to enhance her Lightning Javazon fantasy
  and introduce new talent-interactions for aficionados to really sink their
  teeth into. It would seem that with Cassia lightning does in fact strike twice
  and we are excited to see what you can do with her!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> As Li-Ming has evolved, Wave of Force has become the
  more consistently powerful Heroic. It provides burst damage, CC, and is
  instantly cast, whereas Disintegrate does its damage over time and causes Li-
  Ming to root herself and become vulnerable. Because of this, we're swapping
  the cooldowns of these Heroics to better match their power levels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We always have to be careful about introducing too
  much power into Hero designs that are both mobile and bursty, because even if
  they are balanced on paper, they can feel extremely oppressive to play
  against. When this does happen, our normal reaction is to slowly tune those
  Heroes down until they don't feel awful to play against. Unfortunately, this
  can cause a variety of issues; in Tracer's case, she became extremely reliant
  on a handful of other Heroes to really open up her kit and make it work. With
  her rework, we focused on trying to make her feel a bit more self-reliant
  while also giving opponents a bit more time to react to her Recall and lock
  her down. On top of this, we have rebuilt her talent tree in order to give our
  Pulse-Pistol wielding Heroine some fun new options while she time-jumps around
  the Nexus.</p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blackheart's Bay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot a cannonball at 2 nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage, slowing them by 70% for 1.5 seconds, and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot 5 missiles at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage per missile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cursed Hollow</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 3 seconds, the Core will spawn a Curse under a nearby enemy Hero. If they are Cursed, they take 5% maximum Health as damage and their Armor is reduced by 75 for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dragonshire</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core will throw 2 boulders at a nearby enemy Hero. Heroes hit are turned to stone, damaged for 5% of their maximum Health, and Stunned for 1.75 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Garden of Terror</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core shoots a seed under a nearby enemy Hero. When the seed explodes, Heroes inside are Polymorphed for 3 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hanamura</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core fires 2 volleys of missiles around it, dealing 5% maximum Health to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infernal Shrines</strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Every 12 seconds</strong></span>, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sky Temple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 23 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 sets of 6 tornadoes which swirl around it, dealing 25 damage to enemy Heroes and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 seconds, the Core will shoot a Death Wave, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage to enemy Heroes and slowing them by 70% for 1.25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volskaya</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 6 seconds, the Core shoots 3 Rocket Fists at nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 150 damage and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warhead Junction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 18 seconds, the Core launches a Nuke at a nearby enemy Hero, dealing 30% maximum health to enemy Heroes hit.</li>

<p><strong>Mastery Rings - Tier 3</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Get ready to show off your dedication to your favorite Heroes with the next level of Hero Mastery Rings! These new rings become purchasable once a Hero reaches level 50 and you already own the first and second rings for that Hero.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A.I.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A.I. trees have been refactored in order to reduce conflicts between the tactical and goal systems.</li>
<li>Agents will attempt to stage and wait for backup around objectives before attempting to contest.</li>
<li>Disconnected players will have their A.I. return to base and remain there unless they are pinged to follow. 
<ul>
<li>Follow behavior is the same for disconnected player A.I. and normal A.I.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will attempt to fight while remaining close to their follow target, leashing back if they wander too far away.</li>
<li>While following, the agent will mount or use their Hearthstone if their follow target uses their mount or Hearthstone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting A.I. Healing Well goal health threshold from 75% to 60%.</li>
<li>Bringing an A.I. who is on follow close enough to Doubloon turn-in on Blackheart's Bay, Soul Gem turn-in on Tomb of the Spider Queen, or a healing fountain will cause the A.I. to interact with them appropriately if they are able.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Favorite Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create your favorite talent builds</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can pick their favorite talents on the talent panel from Hero select or draft screen.</li>

<li>Players can create up to 3 builds per each Hero and can activate one build at a time.</li>
<li>To switch to a different build, click the build buttons shown on the top of the talent panel.</li>
<li>If any significant change happens to a talent tier due to a balance patch, the selection for the tier will be reset.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

<li>Health reduced from 2200 to 2080.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.58 to 4.33.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just hit the Public Test Realm and will
be available for playtesting until the week of April 13, PDT. As always, if
you encounter any bugs during your PTR play sessions, please stop by the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/heroes/c/ptr-bug-report">PTR
Bug Report forum</a>
to let us know about your experiences.</p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-a-call-for-help">Nexus Anomaly - A Call For Help</h3>

<p>We've heard feedback over the years that a lot of you would like to feel more
protected by nearby friendly structures. Currently, Minions, Summons, and non-
Heroic units can hold a structure's attention for so long that defending
players feel that they're offered no additional protection when taking refuge
under their Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores. In order to address this
issue, we will be making the following changes to structures:</p>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts, Keeps and Cores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A beam is now created from these structures to their targets, making it easier to see what is being attacked at a glance.</li>
<li>Allied Heroes of the structures who are being attacked by enemy Heroes will cause the structure to focus the offender until the offender is dead or leaves tower range.</li>
<li>A bright beam indicates that the structure is defending an ally Hero and is focusing on the beam target.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting when the Call for Help target becomes invalid.</li>
<li>Structures reset targeting logic when they recover from being disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannon Towers, Forts and Keeps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage to Heroes increased by 10%.</li>
<li>Attacks reduce Hero Armor by up to -40.</li>
<li>Cannon Tower attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 5.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps attacks reduce enemy Hero Armor by 10.</li>
<li>Forts and Keeps no longer slow enemy Heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Core Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We want fights around the Core to feel like exciting ends to cap off great games, and we feel like we can do more to deliver on that front. To that end, this Seasonal Nexus Anomaly will introduce themed abilities to non-ARAM Battleground Cores: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield of Eternity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 8 seconds, the Core will spawn 2 volleys of Frozen Orbs that explode, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage and Rooting enemy Heroes hit for 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blackheart's Bay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every 4 seconds, the Core will shoot a cannonball at 2 nearby enemy Heroes, dealing 5% maximum Health as damage, slowing them by 70% for 1.5 seconds, and knocking them back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Braxis Holdout</strong>
<ul>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matchmaking Changes for GM &amp; Masters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with only one other player.</li>
<li>Master and Grand Master players are no longer restricted to queuing with players who are within 5000 ranked points.</li>
<li>Made some changes to matchmaking rules that should improve the quality of matches for Master and Grand Master players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We have been actively monitoring matchmaking
  throughout the season and are going to be making some changes which will help
  the player experience. Firstly, we found that our party size restrictions for
  Masters players didn't give the experience that we had envisioned, so we are
  reverting these changes. The limit for queueing as a party will require
  players to be within 2 leagues of each other, with Diamond players being able
  to queue up with Master and Grand Master players. Additionally, we have made
  some changes to all regions so that players who are Masters and above should
  find games being made with as many high level players as possible, which
  should result in better matches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Floating Combat Text for experience earned from killing blows now has a unique purple color and displays at the position of the killed unit. Floating Combat Text from experience earned from Experience Globes remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pickup Radius increased from 1.5 to 1.75.</li>
<li>Experience Globes that are actively travelling to a Hero will attempt to follow more closely.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making some small improvements to Experience
  Globes to make them more readable and to improve how they feel to pick up by
  adding a unique purple text that displays where they are killed. With these
  changes, players should more clearly see when they gained experience via a
  killing blow. We also found that sometimes picking up experience globes while
  mounted could be a bit of a hassle due to the pickup radius of the globes as
  well as how quickly they travel to players, so we are slightly buffing both of
  these aspects to make them a little easier to collect in these instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US Region Selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After looking at the causes for North American players' longer wait times and instances of not queuing together, we are bundling matchmaking for our US regions together. This will only happen for players if they have good pings to both sites, and our simulations have shown that we can create better games faster this way. If you don't experience this, please let us know!</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've been teasing the Tassadar rework for a long
  time and it's finally here! Tassadar was previously considered a support Hero,
  but we felt there was a disconnect between his kit/playstyle and the core
  fantasy of a High Templar or the other Protoss magic users. Because of this,
  we've re-imagined Tassadar from the ground up as an ability based Ranged
  Assassin, similar to characters like Kael'thas and Gul'dan. He retains his
  Psionic Storm, Force Wall and Archon abilities and has gained two new
  abilities: Shock Ray and Black Hole. His talent tree has also been radically
  transformed, giving him a slew of powerful new ways to play. We're very
  excited to finally get Tassadar into your hands and hope you all enjoy the
  rework as much as we have!</p>

<h4 id="xul">Xul</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health reduced from 2200 to 2080.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration reduced from 4.58 to 4.33.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're happy with how Xul's rework has gone overall in
  improving his gameplay and talent diversity. He is, however, overperforming,
  so while we wait for more data, we're doing a reduction in the Health he
  gained to bring him more in line.</p>

<h4 id="arthas">Arthas</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Health increased from 2782 to 2860.</li>
<li>Health Regeneration increased from 5.80 to 5.96.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rune Tap [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from 4% to 5% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Army of the Dead [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tooltip now states how much damage Ghouls do.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legion of Northrend [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase Ghoul Basic Attack damage by 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Absolute Zero [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Root duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
<li>Slow duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-Magic Shell [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Arthas is slightly underperforming compared to other
  Warriors, so we're giving him a small baseline Health buff which we feel is
  appropriate since he doesn't have the mobility that a lot of other Warriors
  bring to the table. We've also taken a look at his Level 20 talents and beefed
  them up all be much more epic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="diablo">Diablo</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Devastating Charge [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage when hitting enemies into terrain increased from 120 to 130.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diabolical Momentum [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.25 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Since we changed Devastating Charge Diablo has fallen
  off a bit. While we believe he's in a more healthy spot overall, we understand
  how players miss the unique role he had as a tank who had the ability to burst
  down enemies who are out of position. We're giving a little bit of that back
  in the form of a baseline buff to Shadow charge so that he can have some of
  that fantasy back no matter how players choose to build him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tyrael">Tyrael</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense of the Angels [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 120 to 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Now the Defense of the Angels no longer has a
  cooldown reduction component, we're reducing its cooldown to be more in line
  with similar effects.</p>

<li><strong>Battle Hunger [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing bonus increased from 60% to 70%.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blaze of Glory [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 125 to 135.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pathetic Mortals [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduction increased from 40% to 50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unrelenting Descent [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 5 to 10 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brand of Solarion [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Duration increased from 3 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Imperius a slew of buffs to
  underperforming talents, which we believe will push him into being a more
  stable pick on most maps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="rexxar">Rexxar</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Attack damage increased from 125 to 134.</li>
<li>Misha Health reduced from 1620 to 1520.</li>
<li>Misha Health Regeneration reduced from 3.38 to 3.17.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mend Pet [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mana cost increased from 60 to 70.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Rexxar's ability to win the laning phase on point
  control maps is a little too powerful, so we're nerfing his ability to keep
  Misha alive. To compensate him for this nerf, we're increasing his Basic
  Attack damage, which will both help him in latter parts of the game and make
  the early game more about how well he can work with Misha to outtrade the
  enemy Hero. We're hoping that this leads to more interaction in the laning
  phase, with fewer instances of Misha being able to stand on a point for
  prolonged periods of time while the opposing hero is unable to push her off.
  We know there is a fine line between keeping his unique role on these maps and
  feeling too oppressed when playing against him, so we'll be keeping an eye on
  these changes and will tune as necessary going forward.</p>

<li><strong>Kalan's Edict [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Each time Skeletal Warriors deal damage, reduce the cooldown of Bone Armor and Xul's Heroic Ability by 1.5%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Xul's rework has arrived! Our goal with these changes
  is primarily to make him feel more like a Diablo Necromancer, and to make his
  Skeletons a larger part of his kit outside of their pushing potential. Xul now
  has the ability to spawn Skeletal Warriors in combat via Spectral Scythe, and
  they now explode for damage when they die, giving enemy Heroes a reason to
  stay away from them while they mow them down. We also updated Xul's talents to
  embrace this fantasy, with many options to use Skeletons as a mechanism to
  deliver various buffs to Xul and debuffs to the enemy team. We had a blast
  testing him, and hope you enjoy him as much as we have!</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While decently popular, from a win rate perspective
  Anduin has been underperforming compared to other Healers, so we're giving him
  some buffs largely to underperforming talents to help him out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Gladiator's War Shout a fairly
  substantial buff to make it more powerful and interesting, and as a result
  also buffing Bloodlust. We're hoping this opens up an alternative playstyle
  for Rehgar that can compete better with Ancestral Healing.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've heard feedback from Kerrigan players for some
  time that they would like to have the ability to cancel Chrysalis early. We
  originally intended it to be this way to separate it a bit from other similar
  mechanics and to give opponents a reliable way to counter it, but found that
  it ended up being less fun and interesting overall. Because of this, we're
  adding the ability for Kerrigan to cancel the effect early.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're making this change to reduce the amount of time
  that The Butcher has to commit to a charge before he can cancel it. Currently
  there is an awkward time where he charges and may want to cancel it as soon as
  possible, but he is forced to move a fair amount forward before he can cancel
  his charge. To make this feel more responsive, we're reducing this window of

<li>Damage bonus reduced from 15% to 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our thinking with our Raynor changes in our previous
  patch was to solve a design problem with Ace in the Hole's mandatory synergy
  with Unstable Compound, while simultaneously giving him a bit of a buff
  overall by making his other two talents measure up to its new power. While
  this was largely successful, we underestimated how much more powerful Ace in
  the Hole would become compared to the new, buffed alternatives. We're lowering
  its damage a bit to compensate for the Slow that it gained, which should make
  the tier more even overall.</p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: While under 60% maximum Health, Cho receives 15% additional Movement Speed and healing received.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Each time Cho deals damage to enemy Heroes, he is healed for 60 over 3 seconds. Enemy Heroes hit by Gall's Dread Orb receive 35% less healing for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In regards to his trait, we want optimal play for
  Cho'gall to be to have Gall's Ogre Rage be active most of the time, with
  emergency switches to Cho's Ogre Hide when he is in danger. There are a few
  talents on Cho'galls tree that disincentivize this behavior, which we are
  adjusting now. Calloused Hide in particular was becoming an issue, as players
  have recently been finding it optimal to stay in Ogre Hide for the entire
  game, which removes the gameplay around the trait.</p>

<li>Damage reduced from 63 to 60.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Mal'Ganis have been slightly too powerful for some
  time, so we're toning him down a bit.</p>

<h4 id="muradin">Muradin</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dwarf Toss [E]</strong>

<li><strong>Block [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New talent: Dwarf Block [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Casting Dwarf Toss grants Muradin 4 charges of 75 Physical Armor against the next enemy Hero Basic Attack. These charges last for 10 seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Impact [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slow duration increased from 1.25 to 1.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we've looked at Muradin.
  He's been such a staple in the meta for so long that we did not feel he needed
  any large changes. While minor, these buffs should help bring him back into
  the spotlight as a valuable member of any team.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><strong>Pulverize [W]</strong>

<li>Moved from Level 16.</li>
<li>Slow amount increased from 75% to 80%.</li>

<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lacerate [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Digestive Juices [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gas Flare [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved from Level 13.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're giving Stitches some love by slightly
  increasing his crowd control capabilities and moving his Level 16 talents to
  come online earlier in the game. Since they add a lot of power to his ability
  to function as a powerful front line Warrior for his team, this should help
  him make plays for a greater portion of the game.</p>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="tyrael">Tyrael</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Archangel's Wrath [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Each enemy Hero hit reduces Tyrael's death timer by 10%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ardent Restoration [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing increased from 3.5 to 4 per stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyrael's Level 20 talents have been reordered to follow normal conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Defense of the Angels [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Activate to gain 50 Armor for 3 seconds. Each time Tyrael damages an enemy Hero with a Basic Attack or Basic Ability, increase the duration of this Armor bonus by .5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It has been a longstanding request to make Tyrael's
  trait have some more oomph to it, so we're giving him a thematic change where
  he can reduce his death timer when hitting enemy Heroes. We don't expect this
  to be a huge winrate bump, but we do think it makes it feel a bit better to
  play as the Archangel of Justice.</p>

<h4 id="deathwing">Deathwing</h4>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<li><strong>Incinerate [W]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Healing reduced from 3% to 2.5% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Deathwing continues to be a force to be reckoned
  with, so we're continuing to adjust his power level down. Rather than doing
  one fairly large set of Health, damage, and talent nerfs which can easily go
  overboard, we're taking a more incremental approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="malthael">Malthael</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 4</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throwing Shade [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer has a quest component.</li>
<li>Cooldown reduction reduced from 4 to 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Mana cost of Death Shroud after taking talent increased from 25 to 30.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tormented Souls [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduced from 80 to 60 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Last Rites [R2]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown increased from 65 to 70 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Throwing Shade has not really worked out as an
  interesting Quest talent, as Malthael is often in a solo lane with only one
  opponent. Rather than gate the benefit behind what is often an arbitrary time
  gate, we're going to give him its benefits immediately.</p>

<li>No longer increases the range of Toxic Nest.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the duration of Toxic Nest by 45 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> To curb some of the frustrating gameplay where
  Abathur can continuously backdoor enemy Keeps, we're reducing some of the
  buffs we gave to Locust Strain, as well as changing the functionality of
  Prolific Dispersal. While Abathur players can still do this strategy, it will
  be more difficult to pull off, as Abathur will have to travel to a more
  central location on the map to plant a Toxic Nest for vision to burrow into
  the enemy base.</p>

<ul>
<li>No longer increases the radius of Expulsion Zone.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Expulsion Zone by 25 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been a long time since we made some serious
  changes to Zarya's talents, so these changes should shake things up a bit for
  her. Plasma Shock in particular was not seeing much play, so we're rolling its
  functionality into Pinpoint Accuracy, and buffing other talents on the tier to
  keep their competitiveness. We're also redesigning Clear Out to give a massive
  cooldown reduction to Expulsion Zone instead of a radius increase, as we found
  the radius increase to not be the most impactful or fun Level 20 upgrade.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While our recent changes to Resurrect have put Auriel
  in the spotlight, she has been performing a bit too well compared to other
  Healers for some time now. We're reducing some of her power to keep her more

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While reasonably powerful, Rejuvenation didn't give
  much feedback to the player in regards to the benefit that it provided. We're
  changing the talent to have a little more visual clarity and gameplay compared
  to before, which should help improve its performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't satisfied that the changes we recently

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Fenix has a fairly good talent tree, but we found

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<li><strong>Veteran Marksman [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus damage increased from .75% to 1%.</li>

<li><strong>Ace in the Hole [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemies hit by Give'Em Some Pepper are Slowed by 10% for 2.5 seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unstable Compound [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer adds a Slow to Give ‘Em Some Pepper.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemy Heroes hit by Give ‘Em Some Pepper grant Raynor 10 Mana and reduce the cooldown of Penetrating Round and Inspire by 1 second.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Similar to Orphea last patch, we're removing a use
  case where it often felt like a requirement to take two talents together for
  their full effect. Ace in the Hole will now give Raynor the Slow that he
  desperately wants for its proc, and to make sure that his other Level 1
  talents are competitive, we're giving them a boost as well.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the Mana cost of Concussive Blast from 80 to 40.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We like how the new Barricade is playing, but since
  Sgt. Hammer's Mana tension is now fairly high, taking the talent often meant
  that she would very quickly run out of Mana. We're giving it a hefty Mana cost
  reduction, which should make it an even more attractive pick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> In addition to buffing underperforming talents, we're
  experimenting with giving Locusts a larger presence in Abathur's kit. If left

  good Abathur players who pay close attention to their position on the map and
  the state of the game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We knew Auriel's Resurrect changes were going to be a
  big deal, and for the most part they have been going fairly well. It's now
  picked much more often, and, to our pleasant surprise, isn't winning by a
  large margin over Crystal Aegis. While we like the epic moment of power that
  the current iteration offers, there is understandably a bit of frustration
  with Heroic now. To add some more counter-play, we're reducing its cast range
  and adding more to its cast time to give opponents a better chance to
  interrupt her. Auriel players will now have to choose their moments much more
  wisely if they hope to get a Resurrect off on a key ally who recently died.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Bio-Explosion Switch has always been in a bit of an
  awkward spot due to the opportunity cost of ending Lurking Arm early. To make
  the talent more obviously powerful, we're adding some significant damage to
  the explosion and a larger Silence duration to the detonation to make up for
  the fact that Stukov's Lurking Arm goes away when the explosion happens. Now,
  if Stukov players properly detonate the Lurking Arm right as their enemies are
  leaving it, they should have a significant benefit when taking this talent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While Maiev is a terror in the hands of the more
  elite portion of our playerbase, we don't want that to be a reason to not
  improve talents that we feel could use the help. Cruel Chain and Vengeful
  Knives have parts of their functionality that didn't feel particularly
  impactful, so we're adding more clear and useful benefits to each of them,

  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Samuro's rework, statistically, has gone very well.
  His pick and win rates across his talents are in a better spot, and we believe
  his frustration levels have decreased since the changes. We're being tame with
  our initial changes due to some bug fixes that can change how some talents pan
  out over the long haul. While we wait, we wanted to buff a couple
  underperforming talents that shouldn't be affected by these fixes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying to solve a few issues with Orphea's
  current talent tree. Firstly, we're getting rid of the necessary synergy
  between Ancestral Strength and Fright, opting to instead bake a more reliable
  way to Slow enemies into Ancestral Strength. We're also buffing Growing
  Nightmare so that it's the premier E talent in an E build, as well as giving
  Lurking Terror some love. Ideally, Lurking Terror can now be used as a more
  unique way to set up Q and W hits on enemies who are far away from Orphea,
  particularly when combined with Insatiable for quick double W combos.</p>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Particle Accelerator [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maximum bonus damage for enemies hit reduced from 50% to 40%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Disruption Pulse by .5 seconds, plus an additional .5 seconds whenever Warp Rift explodes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tower Defense [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Reduce the cooldown of Photon Cannon by 4 seconds whenever Probius damages an enemy Hero with Disruption Pulse or Warp Rift.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repulsor [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed.</li>

<li><strong>Interference [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Enemies that are hit by Warp Rift's explosion are knocked away from its center.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We haven't done many functionality changes to
  Probius's talents since his release, so we're now taking a look at places that
  could use some design love. We're targeting Tower Defense and Particle
  Accelerator as talents that should feel more prominent in their respective
  builds, as well as removing Repulsor and baking its functionality into
  Interference, as it wasn't enough of a stand-alone talent to be worth picking
  the majority of the time.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Both Barricade and Pulse Detonation Core have very
  low pick rates, so we're giving them some love, which should hopefully
  incentivize players to try them out more often.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Storm has just been updated with Hero balance changes! Read on
for details.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to the week of March 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loot Chests</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be New Toy Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from New Toy Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gaining Unstoppable now prevents and removes Blinds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We've read recent feedback that it is strange that
  Silences are removed by the Unstoppable behavior, but Blinds are not. While
  Unstoppable has traditionally been primarily intended to remove effects that
  cause a hero to not be able to control the movement of their character, this
  philosophy gets a little grey when it comes to Silences, as heroes can still
  freely move, but they lose their ability to use movement abilities. In the
  past we decided that it was better for Silences to be removed, but understand
  the argument that Blinds are effectively Silences for auto-attack based
  heroes. We're trying this change to see how it pans out, as Blinds have
  traditionally been very powerful forms of soft CC in our game and this can
  help out heroes that are heavily shut down by them.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experience Globes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heroes who kill Minions with Abilities or Basic Attacks will automatically collect the experience from the Minions.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will no longer time out while travelling to a hero.</li>
<li>They will still expire if the hero moves out of range of the Experience Globe before it reaches them.</li>
<li>Removed a .5 second delay before Experience Globes can be collected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> While we're excited for the experience globes and the
  increased clarity that they offer in regards to how experience is gained,
  we've read the feedback that it can be too difficult for many heroes to gain
  the globes. While we think there are some good reasons to keep them as a pick-
  up only mechanic, we overall agree with the sentiment, and are going to allow
  heroes who kill Minions to get the experience from them. We still believe that
  this change will allow for more interesting hero interactions overall, and are
  excited to see how it pans out over the course of the rest of the season.
  We're also including some quality of life changes that should make Experience
  Globes feel generally better to collect.</p>

<h4 id="anubarak">Anub'arak</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locust Swarm [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 62 to 68.</li>
<li>Healing increased from 21 to 24.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debilitation [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spellpower reduction duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beetle, Juiced [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the Health of Beetles by 20%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These buffs are to some of Anub'arak's talents that
  have been lagging behind their competitors for some time. Beetle, Juiced in
  particular should now be more consistent in its benefit to round out a Beetle-
  oriented build, even if Anub'arak isn't able to get a lot of Basic Attacks off
  on enemy Heroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="cho">Cho</h4>

<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surging Fist [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Channel time to charge maximum distance reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calloused Hide [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Ogre Hide is active, Cho gains 15% Movement Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enraged Regeneration [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: While Gall's Ogre Rage is active, enemy Heroes who are hit by Gall's Dread Orb have their Healing reduced by 35% for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 13</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Veil [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor bonus increased from 100% to 200%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It's been awhile since our Old God worshipping Ogre
  has had some love, so we're both buffing up some of Cho's weaker talents as
  well as reducing the time that Surging Fist needs to be channeled in order to
  get a significant charge. This should help make Cho's Q build more viable as
  well as allow him to better reposition himself during teamfights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Condemn [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage reduced from 58 to 55.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Johanna's become a dominant force in the tanking
  world, and is currently the #1 most picked hero at high level play. Because of
  this, we're slightly reducing her Health, as well as reverting her previous
  Condemn buff.</p>

<li>Periodic damage reduced from 12 to 11.</li>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draconic Might [Trait]</strong>

<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfall [E]</strong>

<li>Healing reduced from 5% to 3% maximum Health.</li>

<li><strong>Elementium Plating [Active]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shield amount reduced from 35% to 30% missing Health.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> It turns out that Deathwing has lived up to his name,
  and has been destroying the Nexus since his release. Cataclysm and Burn
  Beneath My Shadow in particular have proven to be incredibly powerful, so
  we're reducing their effectiveness by a fairly significant amount. In addition
  to these changes, we're reducing the power of some overperforming talents as
  well as slightly nerfing his Destroyer form. Even with these changes, we
  expect Deathwing to continue to be a powerful addition to any team that he's
  on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="thrall">Thrall</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling Thunder [Q]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: [Passive] Increase the number of Chain Lightning bounces by 1. For 8 seconds after hitting an enemy with Chain Lightning, Thrall's next Basic Attack against them grants him a stack of Frostwolf Resilience. If the target is an enemy Hero, then he also deals damage to them equal to 2% of their maximum Health and healing for the same amount.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Echo of the Elements and Crash Lightning are both
  fairly solid talents that have different use cases for when to pick them.
  Rolling Thunder has been less successful, so we're trying something new with
  the talent. We're still keeping its theme of marking targets with Chain
  Lightning and then hitting them for a bonus, but now this bonus will allow
  Thrall to deal bonus damage to enemy Heroes while also interacting with
  Frostwolf Resilience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#heroes">Return</a></p>

<h4 id="varian">Varian</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frenzy [R3]</strong>
<ul>
<li>No longer increases Varian's Attack Speed by 15%.</li>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Heroic Strike by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We weren't super happy with the power of Frenzy's
  buff, as well as that it asked Varian players to learn a new Basic Attack
  cadence after being used to one speed the whole game. Instead, we're turning
  the Attack Speed bonus into a bonus to his damage over time by buffing Heroic
  Strike instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="yrel">Yrel</h4>

<p><strong>Talents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dauntless [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical Armor duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 7</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Avenger [E]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Hitting an enemy Hero with Avenging Wrath at maximum charge also increases its damage by 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 16</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templar's Verdict [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damage increased from 6% to 7% maximum Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Favor [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holy Wrath [Passive]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bonus splash damage increased from 20% to 30%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Level 20</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word of Glory [R1]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the amount that Yrel heals from damage received from 50% to 75%.</li>
<li>Range of allied healing increased from 8 to 12.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are mostly looking to buff Yrel's late-
  game by adding more power to her Level 16 talents. We want her to be more
  relevant without dominating the solo lane too much, so we're opting to make
  her Level 16 tier to be an exciting spike for her to hit in her games.</p>

<li>Additional functionality: Auriel can now see her own ghost. If she presses R while dead, she will cast Resurrect on herself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> We're trying some fairly significant buffs to
  Resurrect in order to help it better compete with Crystal Aegis. Auriel can
  now Resurrect herself, which should help if she is the focus of the enemy
  team, and her targets will now come back faster and with all of their Health.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong>

<li><strong>Greater Polymorph [W]</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted functionality: Increase Polymorph's range by 30%. If Brightwing hits an enemy Hero with Arcane Flare's center within 2 seconds of being Polymorphed, then reduce Polymorph's cooldown by 7 seconds and gain 50 Mana.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Our last changes to Brightwing have better rounded
  out her talents, however Greater Polymorph was a little too hard to
  consistently proc. Instead of requiring her to hit a Polymorphed target, she
  now has a slightly larger window of time to get the cooldown reduction proc.
  We're also increasing the cooldown reduction bonus from 6 to 7 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Cooldown reduction increased from 20 to 40 seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Divine Protection [Trait]</strong>
<ul>
<li>New functionality: Increase Devotion's Armor to 40, and its duration by .5 seconds.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> Uther is in a bit of a strange spot at the moment, as
  he has recently had a spike in his win rate, and at higher level play we've
  been seeing him flexed into the main tank role. We think it's pretty cool that
  heroes can sometimes splash into other roles, but in general Uther is
  overperforming, so we're lowering his Health a bit. On an unrelated note,
  similar to Greymane, Uther's Level 20 talents have long been dominated by one
  choice, in this case Redemption. We're giving the other talents on the tier
  some significant buffs so that they can better compete. We hope that this
  won't increase his win rate significantly as Redemption has always been a
  fairly powerful talent, and are prepared to make adjustments if this ends up
  not being the case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> These changes are intended to limit Samuro's split-
  pushing capabilities, particularly with Illusion Master, as well as increase
  his presence in teamfights. A good Samuro player can be a bit of a pain to
  deal with, particularly when he's spending most of his time macroing and not
  engaging with the enemy team except to swap to a far away clone. These changes
  should make this scenario happen less often, while also giving Samuro more
  rewarding tools for engaging and fighting the enemy team.</p>

<ul>
<li>Additional functionality: Increase the damage of Razor Swipe by 100%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Developer Comment:</strong></em> For Greymane, we're giving part of Incendiary
  Elixir's cooldown reduction bonus baseline so that the talent gives him some
  baseline power, as well as making it easier for him to complete the quest. In
  addition to this change, we're addressing his Level 20 talent diversity, which
  has not been the best. We're giving 3 of his talents significant buffs so that
  they can compete with Hunter's Blunderbuss, which has traditionally been the
  go-to option. Unleashed now makes it easier to proc Go for the Throat, as well
  as causing those procs to give him significantly more mobility and damage due
  to resetting his cooldowns. For Gilnean Roulette, we're trying the idea of the
  talent changing Cursed Bullet to be more like a 4th Basic Ability that can be
  used multiple times in a teamfight or as a potent poke tool. Finally, Tooth
  and Claw is now also turning Razor Swipe into a significant source of damage.</p>

<p>The next Heroes of the Storm patch has arrived! The update brings a new Hero,
Deathwing the Destroyer, new Experience Globes, new bundles, new skins, and
much more! Dive on in for more information.</p>

<p><span class="text-warning"><strong>NOTE: Orange text indicates a change between PTR and Live notes.</strong></span></p>

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly – Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="text-warning"><strong>Team Leaders will now be chosen based solely on highest Rank.</strong></span></li>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong>. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from <strong>New Toy Loot Chests</strong> only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>
</ul></li>

<div><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/heroespatches/image/upload/v1494956881/patchlogo2017-05-16.jpg"></div><div class="official-link"><a class="official" href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/23227809" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/23227809" target="_blank">Official Patch Notes</a> <small>v 2.49.0</small></div>

<p>Our next Heroes of the Storm patch has just hit the Public Test Realm and will
be available for playtesting until the week of December 2, PST. As always, if
you encounter any bugs during your PTR play sessions, please stop by the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/heroes/c/ptr-bug-report">PTR
Bug Report forum</a>
to let us know about your experiences.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="nexus-anomaly-experience-globes">Nexus Anomaly – Experience Globes</h3>

<p>Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game
modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season,
allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation,
some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just
be a limited time event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make collecting experience
more satisfying and intuitive, we're changing how experience is collected from
Minions in the Heroes of the Storm. Players will no longer get experience from
simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by
dying Minions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Globes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minions no longer give Experience by killing them, but instead drop an Experience Globe that must be collected. 
<ul>
<li>Footman and Archer Minions (and their equivalent on different Battlegrounds) drop an Experience Globe that lasts for 6 seconds and awards 80 experience (plus 2 every minute).</li>
<li>Wizard Minions no longer give Experience, but Experience Globe values have been increased to compensate.</li>
<li>Experience Globes slowly move toward the closest allied Hero within 6 range, and are collected when an allied Hero comes within 1.5 range.</li>
<li>Experience Globes will not move toward Heroes that are hidden in bushes or Stealthed, but they can be still collected by these Heroes if they move within 1.5 range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few Heroes have special interactions with Experience Globes. 
<ul>
<li>Ragnaros Lava Wave will now instantly collect Experience Globes as it passes by.</li>
<li>Abathur's Symbiote is treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
<li>Hallucinations like Samuro's Mirror Images or Nova's Holo Clones are treated as a Hero for the purposes of collecting Experience Globes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p><strong>Storm League</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players who are Master or above may only queue for Storm League in a party with a maximum of one other player. The second player must also be Master or above. Both players in the party must be within 5000 Rank Points of each other.</li>
<li>Players who have completed their placement games may no longer play Storm League in a party with players who have not completed their placement games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys 2 Event Quests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Toys 2 is the winter event for Heroes of the Storm running from the week of December 16 to week of February 3, PST. Roll dice, complete quests, and join Tickle Mephisto on a board game adventure in the Nexus for awesome rewards... and sweet revenge!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Loot Chests</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During the Toys 2 event, all Loot Chests you earn through progression, Heroes Brawl, or by spending gold will be Toy 2 Loot Chests. (Except Hero-specific Chests, which will remain unchanged.) Most limited-time items shown above have a chance to drop from Toy 2 Loot Chests only. You can also score Items from previous years' winter events limited-time loot chests!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>User Interface improvements for heroes with multiple forms have been added to the Hero Collection and Hero Select Ability screens for Deathwing and to the Hero Select Ability screen for Greymane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI will now pay more attention to lanes that need to be defended or attacked.</li>
<li>AI will no longer be aware of the status of mercenary camps they cannot see.</li>
<li>AI will path through enemy towns less often.</li>
<li>AI will more highly value preventing a mercenary camp from leashing.</li>
<li>Mercenary camp goal base scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent mercenary capture behavior.</li>
<li>Many map goal objective scores have been standardized on all maps. This will make it easier to observe and tweak AI agent objective behavior.</li>
<li>Volskaya Foundry 
<ul>
<li>AI will no longer wait 8 seconds before using the Triglav Protector unless there is a human player on their team.</li>
<li>Agents will be much more consistent and willing to pick up and use Turrets and Bio Emitters on Volskaya Foundry.</li>
</ul></li>
