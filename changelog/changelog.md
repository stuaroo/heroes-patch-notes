## 2017-08-07

## 2017-07-26

* Added [full balance update from 2017-07-26](../patch/2017-07-26-balance-update.html)

## 2017-07-25

* Updated [home page](../) to show Last Balance Change date instead of Last Update date
    * Lately patches have had many bug fixes with few balance changes; this caused many heroes to show as 'updated' when only a bug fix affected them
    * Showing Last Balance date should make it easier to see which heroes changed recently at a glance
