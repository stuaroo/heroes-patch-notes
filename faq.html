              <strong>What am I looking at?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Blizzard periodically releases updates and changes for Heroes of the Storm as patch notes.  I parse these patch notes for talents, abilities, and hero names, and link sections to relevant heroes.  You can then select a hero and see the changes affecting them through patch history.</p>

              <strong>Does this have ALL the changes?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>No, currently I only pull Hero, Design and Gameplay, and Talents sections from patch notes.  The idea is to show changes that will have the biggest impact to gameplay.</p>

              <strong>I already read the patch notes, will this help me?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Probably not, this is aimed more at player's who want to quickly see why a hero feels different.  Let's say I haven't played Raynor in a while (which is true), I can quickly go back through his most recent changes without digging through several long patch note files.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Cool, I will direct you to a great post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vekkul">/u/Vekkul</a> over at the Blizzard forums, <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/forum/topic/18301004598">The Patch History</a> for a list of all patch notes.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Excellent, send me an email at <a href="mailto:heroespatchnotes@gmail.com">heroespatchnotes@gmail.com</a> with as much detail as possible and it'll get updated.</p>

              <strong>Why is there no mention of scaling changes/increased structure damage/battleground changes?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>If a change doesn't mention a hero, talent, or ability, it is not linked to a hero.  This site shows changes related to heroes.  If the community desires sections with these more 'meta' changes, I may find a way to add them in the future.</p>

              <strong>Why no Bug Fixes section?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>In my mind, bug fixes occasionally change gameplay (Ex: Chen's Flying Kick) but more often correct things that are not normal gameplay (Ex: Zeratul's Void Prison causing the Punisher to fly off the map).  If there are strong feelings toward including bug fixes I might look to do this in the future.</p>
